### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Function Naming**:  
   - Rename `SQr` to something more descriptive, such as `calculate_square_root`, to improve code readability and maintainability.  
   - Rename `SQ` to something more descriptive, such as `power_of_self`, to clarify its purpose.  
   - Rename `car` to something more descriptive, such as `integer_division_by_two`, to better reflect its functionality.  

2. **Input Validation**:  
   - Add input validation to `SQr` to handle negative values gracefully, as the current implementation raises a `ValueError` for such inputs.  
   - Add input validation to `SQ` to handle invalid inputs (e.g., `x = 0` or `x < 0`), as the current implementation raises an error in these cases.  
   - Add input validation to `car` to ensure `x` is an integer, as non-integer inputs may lead to unexpected results.  

3. **Type Annotations**:  
   - Add type annotations to all functions for better clarity and to help with static type checking. For example:  
     - `def SQr(x: float) -> float`  
     - `def SQ(x: float) -> float`  
     - `def car(x: int) -> int`  

4. **Code Readability**:  
   - Add spacing around assignment and operators in the `car` function for better readability. For example: `m = water(x)` and `return m // 2`.  

5. **Documentation**:  
   - Improve the docstrings to provide more detailed explanations of the functions, including their input types, return types, and any edge cases or exceptions.

### Suggestions for `b.py`

1. The variable `m` is unnecessary and can be removed to simplify the code. You can directly return the result of the calculation (`x * x`).
2. The function name `water` is unclear and does not describe its purpose. Consider renaming it to something more descriptive, such as `calculate_square_root` or `square_root_of_square`.
3. The parameter name `x` is generic and could be renamed to something more meaningful, such as `number` or `value`.

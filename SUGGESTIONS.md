### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Severity: High, Tag: Input Validation]** - The function `SQR_ADD` does not validate if `x` is negative. Taking the square root of a negative number will raise a `ValueError`. Add input validation to handle such cases.
2. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Naming Convention]** - The function name `SQR_ADD` does not follow Python's PEP 8 naming conventions. Use snake_case for function names, e.g., `sqr_add`.
3. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Comments]** - The comment for the function is misleading. It states "calculate the square root of x and add it to y," but the function actually calculates the square root of `x` raised to the power of 0.5 and adds it to `y`. Clarify the comment.
4. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Readability]** - The inline comments for variables `a` and `b` are unnecessary and do not add value. Remove them to improve readability.
5. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Edge Cases]** - The function does not handle edge cases, such as when `x` or `y` is not a number (e.g., strings or `None`). Consider adding type checks or documentation to specify expected input types.

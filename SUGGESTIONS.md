### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **[High Severity] [Naming]**: The function names (`SQr`, `SQ`, `car`) are not descriptive or intuitive. They should be renamed to better reflect their purpose, e.g., `calculate_square_root`, `power_of_self`, and `integer_division_by_two`.
2. **[Medium Severity] [Error Handling]**: The `SQr` function does not handle negative inputs, which will raise a `ValueError`. Consider adding input validation or a custom error message.
3. **[Medium Severity] [Error Handling]**: The `SQ` function does not handle cases where `x` is 0 or negative, which will raise a `ValueError` or result in undefined behavior. Add input validation or document this limitation explicitly.
4. **[Low Severity] [Documentation]**: The comments are helpful but could be more detailed. For example, explain why certain inputs might cause errors and suggest valid input ranges.
5. **[Low Severity] [Code Style]**: The function names do not follow the PEP 8 naming convention for Python, which recommends using lowercase words separated by underscores (e.g., `calculate_square_root`).
6. **[Low Severity] [Code Style]**: The code lacks type hints, which can improve readability and help developers understand the expected input and output types.

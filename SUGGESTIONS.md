### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **Variable Naming (Low Severity, [Readability])**: The variable names `a` and `b` are not descriptive. Use meaningful names to improve code readability and maintainability.
2. **Function Naming (Medium Severity, [PEP 8 Compliance])**: The function name `ADD` does not follow PEP 8 naming conventions. Function names should be in lowercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., `add`).
3. **Code Comments (Low Severity, [Documentation])**: While the code has comments, they could be more descriptive and explain the purpose of the code rather than just restating what the code does.
4. **Scalability (Low Severity, [Best Practices])**: The code is functional for this specific use case but lacks scalability. For example, if more operations are needed, a class or module structure might be more appropriate.

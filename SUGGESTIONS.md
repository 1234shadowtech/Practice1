### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Unnecessary Floor Division**: The floor division (`//`) of `sqrt_x` by itself will always result in `1.0` for any `x > 0`. This operation is redundant and can be replaced with a direct return of `1.0` for clarity and efficiency.
2. **Unnecessary Import**: Since the square root calculation is trivial in this context (resulting in a constant output of `1.0`), the `math` module import is unnecessary and can be removed.
3. **Improved Docstring**: The docstring can be updated to reflect the simplified logic and clarify that the function always returns `1.0` for valid inputs greater than zero.
4. **Type Hinting**: Add type hints to the function signature for better readability and to align with modern Python practices.
5. **Error Message Consistency**: The error message for invalid input could be more specific, e.g., "Input must be a non-negative number. Received: {x}" to provide more context.

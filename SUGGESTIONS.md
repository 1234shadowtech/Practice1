### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Function Naming (Low Severity, Readability)**: 
   - Rename `sqr` to `square` for better readability and to follow Python's convention of using descriptive function names.
   - Rename `small` to something more descriptive, such as `process_special`, to better convey its purpose.

2. **Type Checking (Medium Severity, Robustness)**:
   - Add type checking or input validation to ensure that the input `x` for both `sqr` and `small` is numeric. This will prevent runtime errors if non-numeric values are passed.

3. **Error Handling (High Severity, Robustness)**:
   - Add error handling for the `special(x)` function in `small`. If `special(x)` raises an exception or returns a non-numeric value, it could cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably.

4. **Dependency Management (Medium Severity, Maintainability)**:
   - Ensure that the module `b` and the `special` function are well-documented and available. If `b` is an external or custom module, consider adding a comment or documentation about its purpose and usage.

5. **Integer Division (Low Severity, Precision)**:
   - The use of `//` for integer division in `small` may lead to loss of precision. If precision is important, consider using `/` for floating-point division or explicitly documenting why integer division is required.

6. **Code Comments (Low Severity, Clarity)**:
   - Add more detailed comments to explain the purpose and expected behavior of each function, especially for `small`, which relies on an external function (`special`).

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Documentation]** Add comments or documentation to explain the purpose and functionality of the imported functions (`small`, `sqr`, `special`) from modules `a` and `b`. This will help other developers understand their usage and expected behavior.
2. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Naming]** Rename the variable `a` to something more descriptive, such as `input_value` or `number`, to improve code readability and clarity.
3. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Comments]** Add inline comments to describe the expected input/output of each function call (`small(a)`, `sqr(a)`, `special(a)`), as their behavior is currently unclear.
4. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Code Structure]** Consider grouping related operations or adding a brief explanation of the overall purpose of the script (e.g., is it performing mathematical operations or transformations?).

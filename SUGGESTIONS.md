### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. The function name `SQr` does not follow the PEP 8 naming convention for function names, which recommends using lowercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., `sqr` or `square_root`).  
2. Similarly, the function name `SQ` should be renamed to follow PEP 8 conventions (e.g., `sq` or `square`).  
3. The purpose of the `SQ` function is unclear. Raising `x` to the power of itself (`x**x`) can lead to extremely large numbers or errors for certain inputs (e.g., negative or non-integer values). Consider adding input validation or documenting the expected input range.  
4. The `car` function uses the `water` function from module `b`, but there is no information about what `water` does. Ensure that `water` is well-documented and handles edge cases properly.  
5. The `car` function performs integer division (`// 2`). If floating-point precision is required, consider using regular division (`/ 2`).

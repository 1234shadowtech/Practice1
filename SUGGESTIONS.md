### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[High Severity] [Bug]**: The function `ADD` is called with only one argument (`a + b`), but it is defined to take two arguments. This will result in a `TypeError`. Fix the function call by passing two arguments instead of one.
2. **[Low Severity] [Style]**: The function name `ADD` is in uppercase, which is unconventional for Python. Function names should follow the snake_case convention (e.g., `add`).
3. **[Low Severity] [Readability]**: Add a docstring to the `ADD` function to describe its purpose and parameters for better code documentation.

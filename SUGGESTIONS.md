### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Naming Convention]** - The function name `SQr` does not follow the PEP 8 naming convention. Function names should be in lowercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., `sqr` or `square_root`).
2. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Readability]** - The function lacks a docstring to explain its purpose. Adding a docstring would improve code readability and maintainability.
3. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Type Hinting]** - The function does not include type hints for the parameter and return value. Adding type hints would make the code more explicit and easier to understand.
4. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Edge Case Handling]** - The function does not handle edge cases, such as when `x` is negative. Taking the square root of a negative number will result in a `ValueError` unless complex numbers are intended.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[High Severity] [Import Error]**: The code imports `SQr` from module `a`, but it is unclear if the module `a` exists or if `SQr` is defined in it. Ensure the module and function are correctly implemented and accessible.
2. **[Medium Severity] [Naming Convention]**: The function name `SQr` does not follow Python's PEP 8 naming conventions. It should ideally be named in lowercase, e.g., `sqr`.
3. **[Low Severity] [Error Handling]**: There is no error handling for the function call `SQr(a)`. If `SQr` expects a specific type or range of input, the code may fail.
4. **[Low Severity] [Code Readability]**: The variable `a` is not descriptive. Use a more meaningful name, such as `number` or `input_value`, to improve code readability.

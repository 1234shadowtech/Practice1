### Suggestions for `b.py`

1. Rename the function `water` to something more descriptive, such as `calculate_square_root_of_square`, to improve readability and clarity.  
2. Update the comment for the return statement to correctly describe the operation being performed (square root of the squared value).  
3. Consider whether this function is necessary, as the operation effectively returns the original input value (`x`). If the function is intended for a specific purpose, clarify its intent in the docstring or comments.

### Suggestions for `first.py`

1. **[Bug, High]**: The formula for calculating the square of a number is incorrect. The current implementation subtracts 1 from the square of `x`. This will lead to incorrect results.
2. **[Style, Low]**: The function name `sqr` could be more descriptive, such as `square`, to improve code readability and clarity.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Critical] Invalid Import**: The `super` keyword is reserved in Python and cannot be used as an identifier. This will cause a syntax error. Consider renaming the function in the `second` module or using an alias during import.
2. **[Moderate] Global Variable Usage**: The global variable `b` is defined outside of any function or class. While this works, it is better practice to encapsulate such variables within a function or class to avoid potential scope-related issues.
3. **[Moderate] Module Dependency**: Ensure that the `first` and `second` modules exist and are correctly implemented. Missing or incorrectly implemented modules will cause runtime errors.
4. **[Low] Error Handling**: There is no error handling for the function calls (`sqr`, `super`, `s`). If any of these functions fail or are not implemented correctly, the program will crash. Consider adding try-except blocks for robustness.

### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **[High] [Naming]**: The function name `super` is not descriptive and conflicts with the built-in `super()` function in Python. Rename it to something more meaningful, such as `sum_of_squares`.
2. **[Medium] [Optimization]**: In the `super` function, `sqr(x)` is called twice with the same argument. This is redundant and can be optimized by storing the result in a variable.
3. **[Low] [Readability]**: The function name `s` is not descriptive. Rename it to something more meaningful, such as `odd_product` or `product_with_remainder`.
4. **[Low] [Commenting]**: Add more descriptive comments to explain the purpose of the functions and their parameters.

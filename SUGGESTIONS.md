### Suggestions for `help.py`

- **BUG:** The `sqr` function name suggests it calculates the square of a number, but it actually calculates the square root (`x**0.5`). Consider renaming the function to `sqrt` for clarity and accuracy.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** The `mod` function could benefit from a more descriptive name, such as `mod2`, to indicate it specifically calculates the modulus with respect to 2.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** The `flo` function name is ambiguous. Consider renaming it to `floor_div2` to clarify its purpose (floor division by 2).
- **STYLE:** Add docstrings to each function to describe their purpose and expected input/output. This improves code readability and maintainability.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

- `IMPROVEMENT:` The imported functions (`sqr`, `mod`, `flo`) are not immediately clear in their purpose or behavior. Consider adding comments or docstrings to clarify their functionality for maintainability.
- `STYLE:` The variable name `a` is generic and does not convey its purpose. Use a more descriptive name to improve code readability.
- `POTENTIAL ISSUE:` If the `help` module is not properly documented or if the functions (`sqr`, `mod`, `flo`) have overlapping or unclear behavior, it could lead to confusion or misuse. Ensure the `help` module is well-documented.
- `IMPROVEMENT:` Consider adding error handling to ensure the functions (`sqr`, `mod`, `flo`) can handle unexpected inputs gracefully.

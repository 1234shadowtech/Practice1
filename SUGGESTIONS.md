### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **[High Severity] [Naming]**: The function name `super` conflicts with Python's built-in `super()` function, which is used for class inheritance. Rename the function to avoid confusion and potential issues.
2. **[Medium Severity] [Performance]**: The `sqr(x)` function is called twice in the `super` function, leading to redundant computation. Store the result of `sqr(x)` in a variable to improve efficiency.
3. **[Low Severity] [Documentation]**: The `s(x)` function lacks a docstring, making its purpose unclear. Add a docstring to explain its behavior.
4. **[Low Severity] [Readability]**: The logic in `s(x)` could be made more explicit for better readability. For example, explicitly state the behavior for even and odd numbers.
5. **[Medium Severity] [Dependency Check]**: Ensure that the `sqr` function from the `first` module is implemented correctly and handles edge cases (e.g., negative numbers, zero, non-integer inputs).

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Critical] Invalid Import Statement**: The `super` keyword is reserved in Python and cannot be used as an identifier. This will cause a `SyntaxError`. Consider renaming the function in the `second` module or using an alias during import.
2. **[Moderate] Missing Context for Imported Modules**: The code assumes the existence of `first` and `second` modules, but there is no verification or fallback mechanism if these modules are missing. Add error handling for imports to ensure robustness.
3. **[Low] Lack of Documentation**: The code lacks comments explaining the purpose of the `first` and `second` modules or the functions being imported. Adding documentation would improve readability and maintainability.
4. **[Moderate] Global Variable Usage**: The global variable `b` is used directly without encapsulation. Consider wrapping the logic in a function or class to avoid potential side effects in larger applications.
5. **[Low] Assumption of Function Validity**: The code assumes that `sqr` and `s` are valid functions without verifying their existence or behavior. Add checks or handle potential exceptions when calling these functions.

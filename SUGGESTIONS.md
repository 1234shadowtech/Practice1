### Suggestions for `app.py`

- **STYLE:** The function names `Sq` and `Sqr` are not descriptive enough. Consider renaming them to `square` and `square_root` for better readability and clarity.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** Add type hints for the return type of `Sqr`. While `int` is specified, the function actually returns a `float` due to the square root operation. Update the type hint to `float`.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** Include docstrings for the functions to explain their purpose and expected input/output.
- **STYLE:** Add spacing between functions for better readability and adherence to PEP 8 guidelines.

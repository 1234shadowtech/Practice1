### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **[HIGH] Naming Conflict**: The function name `super` conflicts with the built-in `super()` function in Python. This can lead to confusion and unexpected behavior. Rename the function to something more descriptive.
2. **[MEDIUM] Lack of Input Validation**: The functions `super` and `s` do not validate their inputs. This could lead to runtime errors if non-numeric values are passed.
3. **[LOW] Code Readability**: The function names `super` and `s` are not descriptive, making the code harder to understand. Use more meaningful names to improve readability.
4. **[LOW] Missing Docstrings**: The functions lack docstrings, which makes it harder for others to understand their purpose and usage.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[High Severity] Invalid Import (`super`)**: The `super` keyword is reserved in Python and cannot be used as an identifier. This will cause a syntax error. Consider renaming the function in the `second` module or using a valid identifier for import.
2. **[Medium Severity] Module Validation**: Ensure that the `first` and `second` modules exist and are correctly implemented. Missing or incorrect modules will cause an ImportError.
3. **[Low Severity] Global Variable Usage**: Using a global variable (`b`) directly may lead to unintended side effects in larger programs. Consider encapsulating the logic in a function or class for better maintainability.
4. **[Low Severity] Error Handling**: There is no error handling for the function calls. If `sqr`, `super`, or `s` raise exceptions, the program will terminate abruptly. Add try-except blocks for robustness.

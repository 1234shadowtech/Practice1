### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **[High Severity] Redundant Computation**: The calculation `(sq(x) - sqr(x)) * 2` is performed twice in the `special` function. This is unnecessary and can be optimized by storing the result in a variable and returning it directly.
2. **[Medium Severity] Unused Variable**: The variable `m` is assigned a value but is never used. This is redundant and should be removed to improve code clarity.
3. **[Low Severity] Dependency Check**: Ensure that the `sq` and `sqr` functions are correctly implemented in the `first` module and handle edge cases appropriately (e.g., invalid input types or values).

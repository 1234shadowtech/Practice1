### Suggestions for `b.py`

1. The function name `water` is misleading and does not describe its purpose. Consider renaming it to something more descriptive, such as `calculate_square_root_of_cube`.  
2. The inline comment is incorrect. The code calculates the square root of the squared value, not the cubed value. Update the comment to accurately describe the operation.  
3. Consider adding type hints for the parameter `x` and the return value to improve code readability and maintainability.

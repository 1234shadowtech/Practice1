### Suggestions for `first.py`

1. **[Low Severity] [Naming]**: The function name `sqr` could be more descriptive, such as `square`, to improve code readability and clarity.
2. **[Low Severity] [Type Hinting]**: Adding type hints to the function parameters and return value would make the code more explicit and easier to understand.
3. **[Low Severity] [Docstring]**: Adding a docstring to explain the purpose of the function would improve maintainability and usability.

### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **[High Severity] [Naming]**: The function name `super` conflicts with the built-in `super()` function in Python. Rename it to avoid confusion and potential issues.
2. **[Medium Severity] [Performance]**: In the `super` function, `sqr(x)` is called twice, which is inefficient. Store the result of `sqr(x)` in a variable to avoid redundant computation.
3. **[Low Severity] [Documentation]**: Add docstrings to both functions to clarify their purpose and behavior, especially for `s(x)` since its logic may not be immediately clear to all readers.
4. **[Low Severity] [Readability]**: The logic in `s(x)` could be made more explicit for better readability, such as using a conditional expression to clarify the intent.
5. **[Medium Severity] [Dependency]**: Ensure that the `sqr` function from the `first` module is implemented correctly and handles edge cases (e.g., negative numbers, non-integer inputs).

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[High Severity] [SyntaxError]**: The import statement `from second import super, s` is invalid because `super` is a reserved keyword in Python and cannot be used as an identifier. This will cause a `SyntaxError` and prevent the code from running.
2. **[Medium Severity] [Code Clarity]**: The code assumes that the `first` and `second` modules exist and contain the respective functions (`sqr`, `super`, `s`). If these modules or functions are not defined, the code will raise an `ImportError` or `AttributeError`.
3. **[Low Severity] [Code Robustness]**: There is no error handling in the code. If any of the imports or function calls fail, the program will terminate abruptly.
4. **[Low Severity] [Code Readability]**: The purpose of the `b` variable and the expected behavior of the `sqr`, `super`, and `s` functions are not documented, making the code less understandable for others.
5. **[Low Severity] [Best Practices]**: It is a good practice to validate the existence of imported modules and functions, especially when working with external or custom modules.

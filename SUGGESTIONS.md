### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Naming]** - Variables `a` and `m` have non-descriptive names. Consider renaming them to something more meaningful, such as `num1` and `num2`, to improve code readability.
2. **[Severity: High, Tag: Dependency]** - Ensure that modules `a` and `c` are available and properly documented. If these modules are external, provide installation instructions or clarify their purpose.
3. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Error Handling]** - No error handling is implemented for the imported functions (`ADD`, `SUB`, `car`). Consider adding try-except blocks to handle potential runtime errors.
4. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Comments]** - While the code is commented, the comments could be more concise and focused on explaining the purpose of the code rather than restating what the code does.
5. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Code Structure]** - If this code is part of a larger project, consider encapsulating the logic in a function or class for better modularity and reusability.

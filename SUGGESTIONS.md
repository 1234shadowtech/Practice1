2. **[Low Severity] [Readability]**: The purpose of the code is unclear. Adding comments or a docstring to explain the intent would improve readability.
3. **[Low Severity] [Scalability]**: If this is part of a larger program, consider encapsulating the functionality in a function for better reusability and maintainability.

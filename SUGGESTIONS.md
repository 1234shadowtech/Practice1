### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Severity: High | Tag: Function Naming Convention**  
   - Function names should follow the PEP 8 naming convention, which recommends using lowercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., `add` and `sub` instead of `ADD` and `SUB`).

2. **Severity: Medium | Tag: Function Behavior**  
   - The `SUB` function's behavior is unconventional. Typically, subtraction is expected to be `a - b`, but here it is implemented as `b - a`. This could lead to confusion for users of the function.

3. **Severity: Low | Tag: Code Readability**  
   - The code lacks docstrings or comments explaining the purpose of the functions. Adding docstrings would improve code readability and maintainability.

### Suggestions for `b.py`

1. **Severity: High | Tag: Functionality**  
   - The function name `SQR` is misleading. It implies that the function calculates the square of a number, but it actually calculates the fourth power (`a**4`). This can lead to confusion for anyone using the function.

2. **Severity: Medium | Tag: Naming Convention**  
   - The function name `SQR` does not follow Python's PEP 8 naming conventions. Function names should be in lowercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., `calculate_fourth_power`).

3. **Severity: Low | Tag: Readability**  
   - The code lacks a docstring or comments explaining what the function does. Adding a brief explanation would improve code readability and maintainability.

4. **Severity: Low | Tag: Testing**  
   - There is no accompanying test or example usage to verify the correctness of the function.

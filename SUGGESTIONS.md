### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Optimize Imports**: Move the `import math` statement to the top of the file to follow Python's best practices for import organization.
2. **Remove Redundant Check**: The second `if x < 0` condition is redundant because the first condition already ensures `x` is non-negative. This can be safely removed.
3. **Clarify Error Message**: The error message for invalid input could be more specific to distinguish between non-finite numbers and invalid types.
4. **Improve Docstring**: The docstring could be updated to clarify that the function does not compute a square root or ratio, as the name might imply. Consider renaming the function for better clarity.
5. **Type Hinting**: While the type hint `x: float` is correct, the function also accepts integers. Consider updating the docstring to reflect this.
6. **Simplify Return Logic**: The return statement is already concise, but adding a comment to explain the logic might improve readability for less experienced developers.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. Consider adding error handling for the imported functions (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `power`, `is_positive`, `is_even`) to ensure the program doesn't crash if unexpected inputs are passed.  
2. The `main` function currently uses hardcoded values for `a` and `b`. It might be more flexible to allow user input or pass these values as arguments to the `main` function.  
3. The `print` statements could be replaced with logging for better control over output, especially in production environments.  
4. The `is_even` function is used, but its utility might be limited in this context. Consider whether it adds value to the program.

### Suggestions for `operations/advanced.py`

1. **Performance Optimization**: The `multiply` function uses a loop to perform repeated addition, and the `power` function uses a loop to perform repeated multiplication. While this is functional, it is not optimal for large inputs. Consider using Python's built-in operators (`*` for multiplication and `**` for power) for better performance and readability.  
2. **Input Validation**: There is no input validation for the `multiply` and `power` functions. Adding checks to ensure that inputs are integers or floats (and non-negative for `power`) would make the functions more robust.  
3. **Naming Consistency**: The parameter names `a` and `b` in `multiply` are generic. Consider using more descriptive names like `num1` and `num2` for clarity. Similarly, in `power`, `base` and `exponent` are clear, but you might want to document that `exponent` should ideally be a non-negative integer.  
4. **Documentation**: Adding docstrings to both functions would improve code readability and maintainability. For example, specify what the functions do, their parameters, and their return values.

### Suggestions for `operations/basic.py`

1. Consider adding type hints to the function definitions for better readability and to help with static analysis tools. For example, `def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:`.  
2. Add docstrings to describe the purpose of each function, expected inputs, and outputs. This will improve maintainability and clarity for other developers.  
3. Include basic error handling or input validation if these functions are expected to handle non-numeric inputs.

### Suggestions for `utilities/validator.py`

1. Consider adding type hints to the function definitions for better readability and to help with static analysis tools. For example, `def is_positive(number: int) -> bool:`.  
2. Add docstrings to the functions to explain their purpose and expected input/output. This will improve code maintainability and clarity.  
3. If these functions are part of a larger module, consider adding unit tests to ensure their correctness.

### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Function Name**: The function name `calculate_square_root_ratio` is misleading because the function does not calculate a square root or a ratio. Consider renaming it to something more descriptive, such as `process_non_negative_input`.
2. **Docstring Clarity**: The docstring could be improved to better reflect the actual behavior of the function. For example, it should clarify that the function always returns 1.0 for positive inputs, regardless of their value.
3. **Type Hinting**: The type hint for the return value is correct, but you could add a note in the docstring to emphasize that the function only returns two possible values: `0.0` or `1.0`.
4. **Edge Case Handling**: While the function handles negative and zero inputs well, it might be worth explicitly mentioning in the docstring that the function assumes `x` is a finite number (not `NaN` or `inf`).
5. **Code Readability**: The comments are clear but could be slightly condensed to avoid redundancy.

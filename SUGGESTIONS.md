### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **[High Severity] Import Issue**: The `from first import sq, sqr` statement assumes that the `first` module exists and contains the `sq` and `sqr` functions. If the `first` module or these functions are not defined, this will raise an `ImportError`. Ensure that the `first` module and the `sq` and `sqr` functions are correctly implemented and accessible.
2. **[High Severity] Undefined Behavior**: The `special` function relies on the behavior of `sq` and `sqr`. If these functions are not implemented correctly or have side effects, it could lead to unexpected results. Verify the correctness of `sq` and `sqr`.
3. **[Low Severity] Code Readability**: The function `special` could benefit from a docstring to explain its purpose and the expected behavior of `sq` and `sqr`.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[High Severity] Import Error**: The `div` function is being imported from `first` and `special` from `second`. Ensure that the `first` and `second` modules exist in the same directory or are in the Python path. If these modules are missing, the code will throw an `ImportError`.
2. **[High Severity] Undefined Function Usage**: The `div` and `special` functions are being called with the argument `a`. Ensure that these functions are defined in the `first` and `second` modules, respectively, and that they accept a single argument. If not, this will cause a `TypeError`.
3. **[Medium Severity] Variable Name Clarity**: The variable `a` is used without a descriptive name. Consider renaming it to something more meaningful, like `input_value`, to improve code readability.
4. **[Low Severity] Missing Error Handling**: There is no error handling for the `div` and `special` function calls. If these functions raise exceptions, the program will terminate abruptly. Consider adding `try-except` blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.

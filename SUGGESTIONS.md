### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **Variable Naming (Low Severity, [Readability])**: The variable names `a` and `b` are not descriptive. Consider renaming them to something more meaningful, such as `num1` and `num2`.
2. **Function Naming (Medium Severity, [PEP 8 Compliance])**: The function name `ADD` does not follow PEP 8 naming conventions. Function names should be in lowercase, e.g., `add`.
3. **Missing Docstring (Low Severity, [Documentation])**: The function `ADD` lacks a docstring. Adding a docstring would improve code readability and explain the function's purpose.
4. **Code Comments (Low Severity, [Clarity])**: While there are comments, they could be more concise and focused on explaining the "why" rather than the "what."
5. **Hardcoded Values (Low Severity, [Flexibility])**: The values `a` and `b` are hardcoded. Consider allowing user input or parameterization for more flexibility.

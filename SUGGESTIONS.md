### Suggestions for `app.py`

- `BUG:` Rename the `sqr` function to something more descriptive, like `sqrt`, to reflect its actual behavior (calculating the square root).
- `STYLE:` Add proper spacing around operators and after commas for better readability (e.g., `a = 10` instead of `a=10`).
- `STYLE:` Use consistent naming conventions for functions and variables. For example, `sqr` and `div` could be renamed to `calculate_square_root` and `divide_by_two` for clarity.
- `IMPROVEMENT:` Add type hints to the function definitions to improve code readability and maintainability.
- `IMPROVEMENT:` Include docstrings for the functions to explain their purpose and expected input/output.

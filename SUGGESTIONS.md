### Suggestions for `b.py`

1. The function name `water` is not descriptive of its purpose. Consider renaming it to something more meaningful, such as `calculate_square_root`.  
2. The variable `m` is redundant and can be removed. You can directly return the result of the calculation `x * x`.  
3. The parameter `x` could benefit from a more descriptive name, such as `number`, to improve code readability.

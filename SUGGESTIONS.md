### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **[Severity: Low | Tag: Naming]**: Rename the `sqr` function to `square` for better readability and to follow Python's naming conventions.
2. **[Severity: Medium | Tag: Type Checking]**: Add type checking or validation to ensure the input `x` in the `sqr` function is numeric. This will prevent runtime errors if non-numeric values are passed.
3. **[Severity: Medium | Tag: Naming]**: Rename the `small` function to something more descriptive, such as `process_special`, to better convey its purpose.
4. **[Severity: High | Tag: Error Handling]**: Add error handling in the `small` function to manage potential exceptions or invalid return values from the `special` function. For example, `special(x)` might raise an exception or return a non-numeric value.
5. **[Severity: Medium | Tag: Dependency]**: Ensure that the `special` function from module `b` is well-documented and available. If `b` is an external dependency, consider adding it to the requirements or documenting its installation.
6. **[Severity: Low | Tag: Comments]**: The comments are helpful but could be more concise. Avoid redundancy in explaining straightforward operations like `x*x`.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Documentation]** Add comments or documentation to explain the functionality and purpose of the imported functions (`small`, `sqr`, `special`) from modules `a` and `b`. This will improve code readability and maintainability.
2. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Naming]** Rename the variable `a` to something more descriptive, such as `input_value` or `number`, to make the code more self-explanatory.
3. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Comments]** Add inline comments to describe the expected input/output behavior of the functions (`small`, `sqr`, `special`) when they are called. This will help future developers understand the code without needing to refer to external documentation.
4. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Error Handling]** Consider adding error handling or validation for the variable `a` before passing it to the functions, especially if the functions have specific requirements for their input (e.g., type or range).
5. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Code Structure]** If the functions are frequently used, consider grouping related functionality or creating a wrapper function to encapsulate the calls for better organization.

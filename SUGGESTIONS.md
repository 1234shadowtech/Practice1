### Suggestions for `app.py`

### SUGGESTIONS:
- **BUG:** The `mod` function definition has a syntax error. The `def` keyword is misspelled as `de`.
- **BUG:** The `mod` function call in `print(mod(x))` uses an undefined variable `x`. It should use `a` or another defined variable.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** The `sqr` function name is misleading. It calculates the square root, not the square. Consider renaming it to `sqrt` for clarity.
- **STYLE:** The variable `a` is defined globally. Consider passing it as an argument to the functions for better modularity and testability.
- **STYLE:** Add spaces around operators (e.g., `x % 2` instead of `x%2`) to improve readability, following PEP 8 guidelines.

### COMMENTED CODE:
def sqr(x):
    return x**0.5  # Calculates the square root of x

def fool(x):
    return x//2  # Performs integer division of x by 2

de mod(x):  # Syntax error: 'de' should be 'def'
    return x%2  # Returns the remainder of x divided by 2

a=10  # Defines a global variable a with value 10

print(sqr(a))  # Prints the square root of a
print(fool(a))  # Prints the result of integer division of a by 2
print(mod(x))  # Error: 'x' is undefined; should use 'a' or another defined variable

### Suggestions for `b.py`

1. **[Severity: High, Tag: Readability]** The names of the imported function (`s`) and the function defined (`car`) are not descriptive. This makes the code difficult to understand and maintain. Use meaningful names that reflect their purpose.
2. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Dependency]** The code assumes that the function `s` from module `a` is implemented correctly and returns an integer. If `s(x)` does not return an integer, the integer division (`//`) could raise an error. Add input validation or handle potential exceptions.
3. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Documentation]** There is no docstring for the function `car`. Adding a docstring would help explain its purpose and expected input/output.
4. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Testing]** There is no indication of testing or validation for the function `car`. Ensure proper unit tests are written to verify its behavior with various inputs.
5. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Import]** The import statement does not specify the full context of the module `a`. If `a` is a local module, ensure it is properly documented and available in the environment.

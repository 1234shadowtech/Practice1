### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **[High Severity] Function Name**: The function name `s` is not descriptive. Rename it to something meaningful that reflects its purpose, such as `calculate_root_product`.
2. **[High Severity] Complex Number Handling**: The function does not account for the possibility of `x` being negative, which results in a complex number. If complex numbers are not intended, add validation to ensure `x` is non-negative.
3. **[Medium Severity] Input Validation**: There is no type checking or validation for the input. If `x` is not a number (e.g., a string or None), the function will raise a runtime error.
4. **[Low Severity] Code Comments**: Add more detailed comments to explain the purpose of the function and the mathematical operation being performed.
5. **[Low Severity] Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases like `x = 0` or very large/small values of `x` to ensure the function behaves as expected.

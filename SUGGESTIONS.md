### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Naming Convention]**: The function name `SQr` does not follow Python's PEP 8 naming conventions. Function names should be in lowercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., `sqrt` or `calculate_sqrt`).
2. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Readability]**: The inline comment in the function header is redundant since the function name (if properly named) and the code itself are self-explanatory.
3. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Robustness]**: The function does not handle invalid inputs, such as negative numbers, which would result in a `ValueError` for real numbers. Consider adding input validation or handling complex numbers if needed.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[High Severity] [Error Handling]**: The code lacks error handling for the `SQr` function. If the function or module `a` is not implemented correctly, or if `a` is not a valid input for `SQr`, the program will crash. Add a `try-except` block to handle potential exceptions.
2. **[Medium Severity] [Code Readability]**: The variable name `a` is not descriptive. Use a more meaningful name to improve code readability, such as `number` or `input_value`.
3. **[Low Severity] [Dependency Validation]**: Ensure that the module `a` and the function `SQr` exist and are correctly implemented. If this is part of a larger project, document the dependency.
4. **[Low Severity] [Commenting]**: Add a brief description of what the `SQr` function is expected to do (e.g., calculate the square root, square, etc.) for better understanding.
5. **[Low Severity] [Type Validation]**: Validate the type of `a` before passing it to `SQr`. If `SQr` expects a specific type (e.g., integer or float), ensure `a` meets that requirement.

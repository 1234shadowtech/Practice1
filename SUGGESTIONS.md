### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Import Placement**: The import statement for `math` was moved to the top of the file, which is good practice. However, it would be better to ensure all imports are grouped together at the top of the file for consistency.
2. **Docstring Clarity**: The docstring is clear, but the phrase "Integers are also accepted as input" is redundant since integers are a subset of floats in Python. Consider removing it for conciseness.
3. **Error Message Improvement**: The error message could be more specific by mentioning that negative numbers, NaN, and infinity are invalid inputs explicitly.
4. **Edge Case Handling**: The function assumes `x` is non-negative but does not explicitly check for negative values. While the `math.isfinite` check excludes NaN and infinity, a separate check for negativity would make the validation more robust.
5. **Type Hinting**: The type hint `x: float` is correct, but the function also accepts integers. Consider updating the type hint to `Union[int, float]` for clarity.
6. **Performance**: The `math.isfinite` check is necessary but could be combined with the type check for efficiency.

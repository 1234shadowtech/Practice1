### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Improve Function Name**: The function name `calculate_square_root_ratio` is misleading because the function does not calculate any square root or ratio. Consider renaming it to something more descriptive, such as `process_non_negative_input`.
2. **Clarify Docstring**: The docstring could be clearer about the purpose of the function. For example, it should explicitly state that the function is designed to return a constant value (1.0 or 0.0) based on the input.
3. **Type Hinting**: While the type hint `x: float` is correct, it might be helpful to explicitly mention in the docstring that the function expects a finite, non-negative float.
4. **Edge Case Handling**: Although the function raises a `ValueError` for negative inputs, it does not explicitly handle cases where `x` is `NaN` or infinity. Consider adding checks for these cases to ensure robustness.
5. **Simplify Logic**: The logic for returning 1.0 for positive values can be simplified by using an `else` statement instead of relying on the implicit condition.
6. **Testing for Special Cases**: Add comments to highlight the importance of testing edge cases like `x = 0`, `x = -1`, `x = float('inf')`, and `x = float('nan')`.

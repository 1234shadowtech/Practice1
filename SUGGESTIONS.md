### Suggestions for `b.py`

1. **Readability**: Add spacing around the `*` operators in the `water` function to improve readability.  
2. **Clarity**: Consider using `x**3` instead of `x * x * x` for better clarity and alignment with Python's mathematical conventions.  
3. **Input Validation**: Ensure the `water` function handles edge cases, such as negative numbers or non-numeric inputs, to prevent unexpected behavior.  
4. **Consistency**: Align naming conventions across files. For example, `SQr` in `a.py` could be renamed to `sqrt` for better readability, and similar improvements can be applied to other functions.

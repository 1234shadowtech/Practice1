### Suggestions for `b.py`

1. **[High Severity] [Naming Convention]**: The function name `SQR` is misleading and does not follow PEP 8 naming conventions. It implies the function calculates the square of a number, but it actually calculates the fourth power. Rename the function to something more descriptive, such as `fourth_power` or `power_four`.
2. **[Medium Severity] [Readability]**: Use lowercase letters with underscores for function names to adhere to PEP 8 guidelines.
3. **[Low Severity] [Documentation]**: Add a docstring to explain the purpose of the function and its behavior.

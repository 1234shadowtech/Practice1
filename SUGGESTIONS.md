### Suggestions for `second.py`

- **BUG:** The function `special` calculates the value `(sq(x) - sqr(x)) * 4` twice, once for the variable `n` and again for the return statement. This is redundant and inefficient. The variable `n` is unused and can be removed.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** If `sq` and `sqr` are computationally expensive functions, the repeated calls to them could impact performance. Consider storing their results in variables to avoid redundant calculations.
- **STYLE:** The function name `special` is not descriptive. Consider renaming it to something more meaningful that reflects its purpose or behavior.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** The behavior of `sq` and `sqr` is not clear from the context. If these functions have side effects or are not pure functions, calling them multiple times could lead to unintended consequences.

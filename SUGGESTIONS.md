### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **Redundancy Issue (High Severity)**: The `special` function calculates `(sq(x) - sqr(x)) * 5` twiceâ€”once for the variable `m` and again for the return statement. This is redundant and can be optimized by directly returning `m`.
2. **Dependency Validation (Medium Severity)**: Ensure that the `sq` and `sqr` functions are correctly implemented in the `first` module and handle edge cases (e.g., negative values or zero) appropriately.
3. **Potential Bug (High Severity)**: If `sq` or `sqr` functions are not defined or have incorrect implementations, the dependent code (`main.py`) will fail when calling `special(a)`. Verify their correctness and compatibility with the `special` function.
4. **Code Clarity (Low Severity)**: Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of the `special` function and why the calculation `(sq(x) - sqr(x)) * 5` is being performed.

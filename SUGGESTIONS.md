### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Function Naming**:  
   - Rename `SQr` to `sqrt` for better readability and adherence to Python naming conventions.  
   - Rename `SQ` to something more descriptive, as `SQ` is not intuitive and does not clearly convey its purpose.  

2. **Input Validation**:  
   - In the `SQ` function, the operation `x**x` can result in extremely large numbers or errors for certain inputs (e.g., negative numbers, large values). Add input validation to handle such cases gracefully.  

3. **Code Readability**:  
   - Add spacing around the `=` operator in the `car` function for better readability.  

4. **Division Precision**:  
   - In the `car` function, consider whether integer division (`//`) is appropriate. If floating-point precision is required, use `/` instead.  

5. **Dependency Check**:  
   - Verify that the `water` function from module `b` is necessary and correctly implemented. Ensure it handles edge cases and does not introduce unexpected behavior.

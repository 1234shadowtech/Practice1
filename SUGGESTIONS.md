### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Severity: High, Tag: Dependency]**: Ensure that the module `a` exists and is accessible in the current environment. If the module is missing or incorrectly named, the code will raise an `ImportError`.
2. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Naming]**: The variable `a` is poorly named and can cause confusion with the module name `a`. Use a more descriptive name for the variable, such as `input_value` or `number`.
3. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Function Validation]**: Verify that the `SSqr` function is implemented correctly in module `a` and that it handles the input `a` (an integer) as expected. If `SSqr` expects a different type or has specific constraints, this could lead to runtime errors.
4. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Readability]**: Add a brief comment or docstring explaining the purpose of the script to improve code readability and maintainability.

### Suggestions for `first.py`

- **IMPROVEMENT:** The function name `matter` is not descriptive of its purpose. Consider renaming it to something more meaningful that reflects its functionality.
- **STYLE:** The string in the `print` statement could be more informative or relevant to the function's purpose, assuming it has a specific context.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** If this function is intended to be part of a larger application, it might be helpful to include a docstring explaining its purpose.

### Suggestions for `yes.py`

[CRITICAL] ⚠️

- [MINOR]: The variable `m` could be given a more descriptive name to improve code readability.
- [MINOR]: The constant `3.14` is a hardcoded approximation of π (pi). Consider using `math.pi` from the `math` module for better precision and clarity.
- [MAJOR]: The function name `loop` is not descriptive of its purpose. It does not indicate what the function does, which can lead to confusion.
- [CRITICAL]: The function does not handle non-numeric inputs for `x`. Passing a non-numeric value (e.g., a string or `None`) will result in a runtime error.

### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The current implementation uses integer division (`//`) instead of floating-point division (`/`). This will always return `1.0` for valid inputs, but it is misleading and unnecessary. The function can be simplified since the ratio of a number to itself is always `1.0` for non-zero values.
2. **Unnecessary Complexity**: The calculation `(x**0.5) // (x**0.5)` is redundant. The function can directly return `1.0` after validating the input.
3. **Error Handling**: The `ZeroDivisionError` is unnecessary because the function does not involve actual division by zero. Instead, a `ValueError` for zero input would suffice.
4. **Docstring Clarification**: The docstring should clarify that the function always returns `1.0` for valid inputs and explain why zero and negative inputs are invalid.
5. **Type Hinting**: Add type hints to the function signature for better readability and to enforce input/output expectations.

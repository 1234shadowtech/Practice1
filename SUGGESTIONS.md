### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **[High Priority]** Ensure that the `sq` and `sqr` functions from the `first` module are correctly implemented and imported. If either of these functions is missing or has issues, it could cause runtime errors.
2. **[Medium Priority]** Verify that the `sq` and `sqr` functions return numeric values. If they return non-numeric types, the subtraction operation (`sq(x) - sqr(x)`) will raise a `TypeError`.
3. **[Low Priority]** Add input validation to the `special` function to ensure `x` is of a type that `sq` and `sqr` can handle (e.g., numeric types). This will make the function more robust.

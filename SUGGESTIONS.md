### Suggestions for `first.py`

1. **Severity: High | Tag: Bug** - The formula for squaring a number is incorrect. The current implementation calculates `x * x - 1` instead of `x * x`. This will lead to incorrect results.
2. **Severity: Low | Tag: Naming** - The function name `sqr` is not descriptive enough. It would be better to use a more explicit name like `square` for clarity.
3. **Severity: Low | Tag: Documentation** - The function lacks a docstring. Adding a docstring would improve code readability and maintainability.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Critical] Invalid Import (`super`)**: The `super` keyword is reserved in Python and cannot be used as an identifier. This will cause a syntax error. Consider renaming the function in the `second` module or using an alias during import.
2. **[Moderate] Global Variable (`b`)**: Using a global variable (`b`) is not ideal for maintainability and scope control. Encapsulate it within a function or class to avoid potential conflicts and improve readability.
3. **[Moderate] Module Validation**: Ensure that the `first` and `second` modules exist and contain the respective functions (`sqr`, `super`, and `s`). Missing or incorrect module definitions will lead to runtime errors.
4. **[Low] Error Handling**: Add error handling (e.g., `try-except`) around the function calls to gracefully handle potential issues like missing functions or invalid arguments.
5. **[Low] Code Comments**: While the code has inline comments, they could be more concise and focused on explaining the purpose rather than repeating the code logic.

### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **[High Severity] [Naming]**: The function name `super` is a reserved keyword in Python and should not be used as a function name. Rename it to something more descriptive, such as `sum_of_squares`.
2. **[Medium Severity] [Optimization]**: In the `super` function, the `sqr(x)` function is called twice with the same argument. This is redundant and can be optimized by storing the result in a variable.
3. **[Low Severity] [Readability]**: The function name `s` is not descriptive. Rename it to something meaningful, such as `odd_multiplier`, to improve code readability.
4. **[Low Severity] [Commenting]**: Add more descriptive comments to explain the purpose of the functions and their parameters.

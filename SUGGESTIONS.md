### Suggestions for `main.py`

- **BUG:** The function `substract` is likely misspelled. It should be `subtract` unless the spelling is intentional for some reason.
- **STYLE:** The variable names `a` and `b` are not descriptive. Consider using more meaningful names to improve code readability, such as `num1` and `num2`.
- **STYLE:** The import statements are not organized. It is a good practice to group imports logically (e.g., standard library imports, third-party imports, local imports) and alphabetize them within each group.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** There is no error handling for the `substract` and `s` functions. If these functions fail or raise exceptions, the program will terminate without providing meaningful feedback.

### Suggestions for `special.py`

- **IMPROVEMENT:** The function name `s` is not descriptive. Consider renaming it to something more meaningful, such as `double_sum` or `scaled_addition`, to improve code readability.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** The `add` function is imported from `help`, but its behavior is not clear from the context. Ensure that `add` handles edge cases (e.g., non-numeric inputs) appropriately, as this function depends on it.
- **STYLE:** The multiplication operation `*2` is directly applied to the result of `add(x, x)`. Adding parentheses for clarity, even though not strictly necessary, could improve readability (e.g., `return (add(x, x)) * 2`).

### Suggestions for `help.py`

- `STYLE:` The function name `substract` is misspelled. It should be `subtract` to align with standard spelling conventions and improve readability.
- `IMPROVEMENT:` Consider adding type hints to the function definitions to clarify the expected input types and return type (e.g., `def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:`).
- `IMPROVEMENT:` Add docstrings to both functions to describe their purpose and expected behavior. This will improve code maintainability and clarity for other developers.
- `POTENTIAL ISSUE:` The functions do not handle edge cases, such as non-numeric inputs. Consider adding input validation or specifying in the docstring that the functions assume numeric inputs.

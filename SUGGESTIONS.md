### Suggestions for `app.py`

- `BUG:` The function `sqr` is incorrectly named. Based on its implementation (`x**0.5`), it calculates the square root, not the square. Consider renaming it to `sqrt` for clarity.
- `STYLE:` Use consistent naming conventions for functions. For example, `fool` could be renamed to something more descriptive like `halve_integer`.
- `IMPROVEMENT:` Add type hints to the function definitions to improve code readability and maintainability. For example, `def sqr(x: float) -> float`.
- `IMPROVEMENT:` Add docstrings to each function to explain their purpose and expected input/output.
- `IMPROVEMENT:` Consider handling edge cases, such as negative numbers in `sqr`, which will result in complex numbers.

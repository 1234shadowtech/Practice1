### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **[High Severity]** Ensure that the `sq` and `sqr` functions in the `first` module are correctly implemented and do not raise any runtime errors. If these functions are not defined or have issues, it will cause the `special` function to fail.
2. **[Medium Severity]** Verify that the `first` module is in the correct path and accessible. If the module is not found, it will raise an `ImportError`.
3. **[Low Severity]** Consider adding error handling in the `special` function to manage unexpected inputs (e.g., non-numeric values) to prevent runtime errors.

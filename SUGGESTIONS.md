### Suggestions for `yes.py`

1. **[Critical] Variable Initialization**: The variable `m` is used without being initialized, which will result in a `NameError`. Initialize `m` before using it.
2. **[Critical] Missing Return Statement**: The function does not return any value, making it unclear what the purpose of the function is.
3. **[Moderate] Unused Computation**: The computed value of `m` is not stored, returned, or used elsewhere, making the loop redundant.
4. **[Low] Input Validation**: The function does not validate the input `x`. If `x` is not an integer or is negative, the loop may behave unexpectedly.
5. **[Low] Function Naming**: The function name `loop` is generic and does not describe its purpose. Consider using a more descriptive name.

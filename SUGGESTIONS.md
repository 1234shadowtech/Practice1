### Suggestions for `app.py`

- **STYLE:** The function name `Sq` is not descriptive. Consider renaming it to something more meaningful, like `square` or `calculate_square`, to improve readability.
- **STYLE:** Add a docstring to the function `Sq` to describe its purpose and expected input/output.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** Include type hints for the return value of the function `Sq`. For example, `def Sq(x: int) -> int:`.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** Add input validation to the function `Sq` to ensure it handles unexpected inputs gracefully (e.g., non-integer values).
- **IMPROVEMENT:** Consider using a main function or entry point (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) to structure the script better for scalability and readability.

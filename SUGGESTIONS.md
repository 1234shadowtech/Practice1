### Suggestions for `b.py`

1. The function name `water` is not descriptive of its purpose. Consider renaming it to something more meaningful, such as `calculate_root_of_cube` or `cube_root_approximation`.  
2. The variable name `m` is not descriptive. Use a name that reflects its purpose, such as `cubed_value`.  
3. The calculation `x * x * x` can be replaced with `x**3` for better readability and efficiency.  
4. The function does not handle edge cases like negative inputs or non-numeric values. Consider adding input validation or documenting the expected input types.

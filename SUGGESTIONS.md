### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Low Severity] [Redundancy]**: The code contains two print statements that perform the same operation (`a + b` and `b + a`). Since addition is commutative, the second print statement is redundant and can be removed.
2. **[Low Severity] [Readability]**: Variable names `a` and `b` are not descriptive. Using more meaningful names would improve code readability and maintainability.
3. **[Low Severity] [Formatting]**: Adding spaces around the `=` operator in variable assignments would improve code readability and adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Low Severity] [Unused Variable]**: The loop variable `i` is unused in the loop body. If the index is not needed, consider using `_` as a convention to indicate that the variable is intentionally unused.
2. **[Low Severity] [Optimization]**: If the goal is to repeat an action a fixed number of times, using `range(10)` is fine, but the code could be made more explicit by using a more descriptive comment or structure.

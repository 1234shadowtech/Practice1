### Suggestions for `yes.py`

1. **[Critical] Variable Initialization**: The variable `m` is used in the loop but is not initialized before being incremented. This will raise a `NameError`.
2. **[Critical] Return Statement**: The function does not return any value, making it unclear what the purpose of the function is.
3. **[Moderate] Function Naming**: The function name `loop` is too generic and does not describe its purpose. Consider using a more descriptive name.
4. **[Low] Type Hinting**: Adding type hints for the parameter `x` and the return type would improve code readability and maintainability.
5. **[Low] Docstring**: The function lacks a docstring to explain its purpose and usage.

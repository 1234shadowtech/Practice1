### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Move the `import math` statement to the top of the file**: This is a standard Python practice to keep imports organized and at the top of the file.
2. **Simplify the validation logic**: The `isinstance` and `math.isfinite` checks can be combined into a single conditional for better readability.
3. **Clarify the docstring**: The docstring is mostly clear, but it could explicitly state that the function does not compute a square root or ratio, as the name might imply.
4. **Improve error messages**: The error messages are clear but could be slightly more concise while still being informative.
5. **Add type hints for clarity**: The function already uses type hints, which is good practice. No changes needed here.
6. **Optimize the return statement**: The return logic is already simplified, so no further changes are necessary.

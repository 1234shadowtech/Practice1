### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Function Naming**:  
   - The function names `SQr` and `SQ` do not follow PEP 8 naming conventions. Consider renaming them to `sqrt` and `power_mult` (or something more descriptive) for better readability and compliance.  
   - The name `car` is not descriptive of its purpose. Consider renaming it to something that reflects its functionality.  

2. **Potential Input Issues**:  
   - The `SQ` function `(x**x)*4` can lead to issues with certain inputs, such as negative numbers or large values of `x`, which may cause overflows or raise exceptions. Consider adding input validation or handling edge cases.  

3. **Code Readability**:  
   - Adding docstrings to the functions would improve code readability and help other developers understand their purpose.  

4. **Dependency Clarity**:  
   - The `water` function is imported from module `b`, but its behavior is not clear from the context. Ensure that `water` is well-documented and handles edge cases properly.

### Suggestions for `b.py`

1. The function name `water` is not descriptive of its purpose. Consider renaming it to something more meaningful, such as `square` or `calculate_square`.  
2. The variable `m` could be renamed to something more descriptive, like `result` or `squared_value`, to improve code readability.  
3. Add a docstring to explain the purpose of the function and its parameters.

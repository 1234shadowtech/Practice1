### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Severity: High | Bug** - The formula for calculating the square root is incorrect. The current implementation `x*x**0.5` does not compute the square root of `x`. Instead, it multiplies `x` by the square root of `x`. The correct formula should be `x**0.5`.
2. **Severity: Low | Naming** - The function name `SSqr` is not descriptive or intuitive. It does not clearly convey the purpose of the function. A more descriptive name like `square_root` or `calculate_square_root` would improve readability.
3. **Severity: Low | Style** - The function does not include a docstring. Adding a docstring would help explain the purpose and usage of the function.
4. **Severity: Low | Validation** - The function does not handle invalid inputs, such as negative numbers or non-numeric values. Adding input validation would make the function more robust.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[High Severity] [Import Issue]**: The code imports `SSqr` from module `a`, but there is no context provided about the existence or content of module `a`. Ensure that the module `a` exists and contains the `SSqr` function.
2. **[Medium Severity] [Naming Convention]**: The variable `a` is used both as the module name and as a variable name. This can lead to confusion and is not a good practice. Consider renaming the variable to something more descriptive.
3. **[Low Severity] [Code Readability]**: The code lacks comments or documentation to explain what `SSqr` does or why it is being used. Adding comments would improve readability and maintainability.

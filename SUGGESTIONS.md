### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **[High Severity] Function Naming Convention**: The function names `SQr`, `SQ`, and `car` do not follow Python's PEP 8 naming conventions. Function names should be in lowercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., `sqr`, `sq`, `calculate_half`).
2. **[Medium Severity] Misleading Function Name (`SQ`)**: The function `SQ` raises `x` to the power of itself (`x**x`), which is not a standard mathematical operation and could be misleading. The name should better reflect its purpose.
3. **[Low Severity] Lack of Documentation**: None of the functions have docstrings to explain their purpose, input, or output. Adding docstrings would improve code readability and maintainability.
4. **[Low Severity] Lack of Input Validation**: The functions do not validate their inputs. For example, `SQr` will raise a `ValueError` for negative inputs, and `SQ` may cause unexpected behavior for certain values of `x` (e.g., `x = 0` or `x < 0`).
5. **[Low Severity] Unused Functions**: The code does not demonstrate how these functions are used, making it unclear what their purpose is in the broader context.

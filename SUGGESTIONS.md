### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. The function name `SQr` does not follow the PEP 8 naming convention for function names, which recommends using lowercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., `sqrt`).  
2. Similarly, the function name `SQ` does not follow PEP 8 naming conventions. A more descriptive name would also improve readability.  
3. The logic in the `SQ` function seems unusual and potentially problematic. Raising `x` to the power of itself (`x**x`) can lead to extremely large numbers or errors for certain inputs (e.g., negative numbers or large positive numbers). Consider validating the input or clarifying the intended use case.  
4. The `car` function uses the `water` function from module `b`, but there is no information about its implementation. Ensure that `water` handles edge cases and exceptions properly.  
5. Add docstrings to all functions to describe their purpose, expected inputs, and outputs.

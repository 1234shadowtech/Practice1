### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **[High Severity] [Naming]**: The function name `super` is problematic because it shadows the built-in `super()` function in Python. This can lead to confusion and potential issues in more complex codebases.
2. **[Medium Severity] [Performance]**: In the `super` function, the `sqr(x)` function is called twice with the same argument. This is inefficient and can be optimized by storing the result of `sqr(x)` in a variable.
3. **[Low Severity] [Readability]**: The function name `s` is not descriptive and does not convey its purpose. It should be renamed to something more meaningful.
4. **[Low Severity] [Comment Clarity]**: The inline comments are somewhat redundant and do not add much value. They should be revised to provide more meaningful explanations.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[High Severity] Invalid Import**: The `super` keyword is reserved in Python and cannot be used as an identifier. This will cause a syntax error. Consider renaming the function in the `second` module or using a valid identifier for import.
2. **[Medium Severity] Module Validation**: Ensure that the `first` and `second` modules exist and are accessible in the current environment. Missing modules will cause an `ImportError`.
3. **[Low Severity] Global Variable Usage**: The global variable `b` is used directly without any encapsulation or validation. Consider wrapping it in a function or class for better maintainability.
4. **[Medium Severity] Error Handling**: There is no error handling for the function calls (`sqr`, `super`, `s`). If any of these functions fail, the program will terminate abruptly. Add try-except blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.
5. **[Low Severity] Code Readability**: Add comments or docstrings to explain the purpose of the code and the expected behavior of the imported functions.

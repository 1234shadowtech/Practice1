### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Low Severity] [Readability]**: The loop variable `i` is unused in the code. If the variable is not needed, consider using `_` as a convention to indicate that it is intentionally unused.
2. **[Low Severity] [Performance]**: The range `range(0, 10)` can be simplified to `range(10)` for better readability, as the default start value is `0`.

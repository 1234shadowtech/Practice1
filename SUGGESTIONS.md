### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **[High] Naming Conventions**: The function name `super` is not descriptive and conflicts with the built-in `super()` function in Python. Rename it to something more meaningful, such as `sum_of_squares`.
2. **[Medium] Redundant Computation**: In the `super` function, `sqr(x)` is called twice with the same argument. This can be optimized by storing the result in a variable.
3. **[Low] Lack of Documentation**: The code lacks proper docstrings for the functions. Adding docstrings would improve readability and maintainability.
4. **[Low] Module Dependency**: The `sqr` function is imported from the `first` module, but there is no context about what `first` is. Ensure the `first` module is available and properly documented.
5. **[Low] Function Name `s`**: The function name `s` is too short and not descriptive. Rename it to something like `product_with_remainder` for clarity.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[High Severity] Invalid Import**: The `super` keyword is reserved in Python and cannot be used as an identifier. This will cause a syntax error. Consider renaming the function in the `second` module or using a valid identifier for import.
2. **[Medium Severity] Module Validation**: Ensure that the `first` and `second` modules exist and are correctly implemented. Missing or incorrect modules will cause an `ImportError`.
3. **[Low Severity] Global Variable Usage**: The global variable `b` is used directly without any encapsulation or validation. Consider wrapping it in a function or class for better maintainability and scope control.
4. **[Medium Severity] Error Handling**: There is no error handling for the function calls (`sqr`, `super`, `s`). If any of these functions fail or are not implemented correctly, the program will crash. Add appropriate try-except blocks.
5. **[Low Severity] Code Readability**: Inline comments are sparse. Adding more descriptive comments for each line would improve code readability.

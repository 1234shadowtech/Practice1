### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **[High Severity] [Naming]**: The function name `super` is not descriptive and conflicts with the built-in `super()` function in Python. This can lead to confusion and potential issues in larger codebases.
2. **[Medium Severity] [Performance]**: The `super` function calls `sqr(x)` twice, which is redundant and inefficient. The result of `sqr(x)` should be stored in a variable to avoid repeated computation.
3. **[Low Severity] [Readability]**: The function name `s` is not descriptive and does not convey its purpose. It should be renamed to something more meaningful.
4. **[Low Severity] [Commenting]**: While the comments are present, they could be more concise and focused on explaining the purpose of the functions rather than their implementation details.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[High Severity] Invalid Import**: The import statement `from second import super, s` is invalid because `super` is a reserved keyword in Python and cannot be used as an identifier. This will cause a syntax error.
2. **[Medium Severity] Module Validation**: Ensure that the `first` and `second` modules exist and are accessible in the current environment. Missing or incorrect modules will lead to an `ImportError`.
3. **[Low Severity] Code Readability**: Add comments or docstrings to explain the purpose of the code for better maintainability.
4. **[Medium Severity] Error Handling**: No error handling is present. If the `sqr`, `super`, or `s` functions are not defined or fail, the program will crash. Consider adding try-except blocks.
5. **[Low Severity] Reserved Keyword Usage**: Avoid using reserved keywords like `super` in any context where it might cause confusion or errors.

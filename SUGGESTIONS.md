### Suggestions for `second.py`

- **BUG:** The `special` function redundantly calculates `(sq(x) - sqr(x)) * 2` twice, which is inefficient. The result should be stored in a variable and reused.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** The `special` function could benefit from a more descriptive name or a docstring to clarify its purpose.
- **STYLE:** The variable `m` is defined but never used. This is unnecessary and should be removed to avoid confusion.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** Ensure that the `sq` and `sqr` functions from the `first` module are correctly implemented and handle edge cases (e.g., negative numbers or non-numeric inputs) since their behavior directly impacts the correctness of `special`.

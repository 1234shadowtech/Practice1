### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Function Naming**:  
   - Rename `SQr` to `square_root` for better readability and adherence to Python naming conventions.  
   - Rename `SQ` to something more descriptive, such as `exponential_scaled`, to clarify its purpose.  

2. **Potential Overflow in `SQ`**:  
   - The calculation `(x**x)*5` in `SQ` can lead to extremely large numbers or errors for certain inputs (e.g., negative values or large positive values). Consider adding input validation or handling edge cases to prevent runtime errors.  

3. **Integer Division in `car`**:  
   - Confirm that integer division (`//`) is the intended behavior in `car`. If floating-point division is required, use `/` instead.  

4. **Dependency on `water`**:  
   - Ensure the `water` function from module `b` is well-documented, tested, and handles edge cases appropriately, as it is used twice in `car`.

### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **[High Severity] [Naming]**: The function name `super` is a reserved keyword in Python and should not be used as a function name. This can lead to confusion and potential issues in the code.
2. **[Medium Severity] [Performance]**: The `super` function calls `sqr(x)` twice, which is redundant and inefficient. The result of `sqr(x)` should be stored in a variable to avoid repeated computation.
3. **[Low Severity] [Naming]**: The function name `s` is not descriptive and does not convey the purpose of the function. Use a more meaningful name to improve code readability.
4. **[Low Severity] [Commenting]**: The comments are present but could be more detailed to explain the purpose and behavior of the functions for better understanding.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[High Severity] Invalid Import**: The `super` keyword is reserved in Python and cannot be used as an identifier. This will cause a syntax error. Consider renaming the function in the `second` module or using a different alias during import.
2. **[Medium Severity] Module Validation**: Ensure that the `first` and `second` modules exist and are correctly implemented. Missing or incorrect modules will result in an `ImportError`.
3. **[Low Severity] Global Variable Usage**: The global variable `b` is used directly without any encapsulation or validation. Consider wrapping it in a function or class for better maintainability and readability.
4. **[Low Severity] Error Handling**: There is no error handling for the function calls. If `sqr`, `super`, or `s` fail, the program will terminate abruptly. Add try-except blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.

### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **[High | Naming]**: The function name `super` is not descriptive and conflicts with the built-in `super()` function in Python. Rename it to something more meaningful, such as `sum_of_squares`.
2. **[Medium | Efficiency]**: The `super` function calls `sqr(x)` twice, which is redundant. Store the result of `sqr(x)` in a variable to improve efficiency.
3. **[Low | Readability]**: The function name `s` is too short and not descriptive. Rename it to something more meaningful, such as `product_with_remainder`.
4. **[Low | Commenting]**: Add more descriptive comments to explain the purpose of the functions and their parameters.
5. **[Low | Import]**: Ensure that the `first` module and its `sqr` function are available and correctly implemented, as this code depends on them.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Critical] Invalid Import (`super`):** The `super` keyword is reserved in Python and cannot be used as an identifier. This will cause a syntax error. Consider renaming the function in the `second` module or using a valid identifier for import.
2. **[Moderate] Module Validation (`first` and `second`):** Ensure that the `first` and `second` modules exist and are accessible. If they are custom modules, verify their paths and contents.
3. **[Moderate] Error Handling:** Add error handling for the function calls (`sqr`, `super`, `s`) to gracefully handle potential issues like missing functions or invalid arguments.
4. **[Low] Code Readability:** Add comments or docstrings to explain the purpose of the code and the imported functions for better maintainability.

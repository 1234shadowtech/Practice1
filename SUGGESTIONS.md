### Suggestions for `c.py`

1. **Severity: Medium | Tag: Naming**  
   - The function name `car` is not descriptive and does not convey its purpose. Consider renaming it to something more meaningful, such as `sum_of_squares` or `calculate_square_sum`.

2. **Severity: High | Tag: Dependency**  
   - The code depends on the `SQR` function from module `b`. Ensure that `SQR` is properly defined, imported, and tested. If `SQR` is not robust (e.g., does not handle invalid inputs), it could lead to runtime errors.

3. **Severity: Medium | Tag: Input Validation**  
   - There is no input validation for the arguments `a` and `c`. If non-numeric or invalid inputs are passed, the function may fail. Consider adding checks or handling exceptions to ensure the inputs are valid.

4. **Severity: Low | Tag: Comments**  
   - While the inline comments are helpful, they could be more concise and focus on the purpose of the code rather than restating what the code does.

5. **Severity: Low | Tag: Documentation**  
   - The function lacks a docstring. Adding a docstring would improve code readability and help other developers understand its purpose and usage.

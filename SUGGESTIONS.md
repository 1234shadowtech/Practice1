### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Severity: Low] [Tag: Naming Conventions]**: The function name `ADD` is in uppercase, which is not consistent with Python's PEP 8 naming conventions. Function names should be in lowercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., `add`).
2. **[Severity: Low] [Tag: Readability]**: The variable names `a` and `b` are not descriptive. Using more meaningful names (e.g., `num1`, `num2`) would improve code readability.
3. **[Severity: Low] [Tag: Code Style]**: There is no space around the assignment operator (`=`) in the variable declarations. Adding spaces improves readability and adheres to PEP 8.
4. **[Severity: Low] [Tag: Code Style]**: The code lacks a main guard (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) to ensure proper execution when the script is run directly.
5. **[Severity: Low] [Tag: Documentation]**: The function `ADD` lacks a docstring to explain its purpose and parameters.

### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Function Naming (Low Severity, Readability)**: The function names (`SQr`, `SQ`, `car`) are not descriptive and do not convey the purpose of the functions clearly. Consider renaming them to more meaningful names such as:
   - `SQr` → `calculate_square_root`
   - `SQ` → `power_of_self`
   - `car` → `integer_division_by_two`

2. **Input Validation (High Severity, Robustness)**:
   - `SQr`: The function does not handle negative inputs, which will raise a `ValueError`. Add input validation to handle such cases gracefully.
   - `SQ`: The function does not handle invalid inputs like `x = 0` or `x < 0`, which will raise errors. Add input validation to ensure the function behaves predictably.

3. **Code Comments (Medium Severity, Maintainability)**: While the code has some comments, they could be more detailed and consistent. For example, explicitly mention the expected input types and edge cases.

4. **Unusual Operation in `SQ` (Medium Severity, Usability)**: The operation `x**x` is uncommon and may not be intuitive to users. Consider documenting the purpose of this function more clearly or re-evaluating its necessity.

5. **Type Annotations (Low Severity, Best Practices)**: Adding type annotations to the function signatures would improve code readability and help other developers understand the expected input and output types.

6. **Edge Case Handling (High Severity, Robustness)**: None of the functions handle edge cases explicitly. For example:
   - `SQr`: Negative inputs.
   - `SQ`: Zero or negative inputs.
   - `car`: Non-integer inputs.

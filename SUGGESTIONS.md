### Suggestions for `main.py`

- **IMPROVEMENT:** The function name `sqr` could be more descriptive, such as `square`, to improve readability and clarity.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** The function name `mod` could be more descriptive, such as `modulus_of_two` or `is_odd`, depending on its intended use, to make its purpose clearer.
- **STYLE:** Add a blank line between the function definitions for better readability and adherence to PEP 8 guidelines.
- **STYLE:** The inline comment for `a = 10` could be rephrased to clarify that `a` is an example input value for demonstration purposes.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** The `mod` function is defined but not used in the provided code. If it is not needed, consider removing it to avoid confusion.

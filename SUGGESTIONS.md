### Suggestions for `c.py`

1. **Severity: Medium | Tag: Naming**  
   - The function name `car` is not descriptive and does not convey its purpose. Consider renaming it to something more meaningful, such as `sum_of_squares` or `calculate_squares_sum`.

2. **Severity: High | Tag: Dependency**  
   - The code depends on the `SQR` function from module `b`. Ensure that `SQR` is properly defined, tested, and handles edge cases (e.g., non-numeric inputs, negative numbers, etc.). If `SQR` is not reliable, the function `car` may fail.

3. **Severity: Medium | Tag: Error Handling**  
   - There is no error handling in the function `car`. If `SQR` or the inputs `a` and `c` are invalid, the function may raise an exception. Consider adding input validation or exception handling.

4. **Severity: Low | Tag: Comments**  
   - While the code is simple, adding a docstring to the function `car` would improve readability and clarify its purpose.

5. **Severity: Low | Tag: Import**  
   - The import statement is not validated in this snippet. Ensure that module `b` exists and is accessible in the runtime environment.

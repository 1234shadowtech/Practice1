### Suggestions for `second.py`

- **BUG:** The variable `n` is assigned but never used. This is redundant and should be removed to avoid confusion.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** The calculation `(sq(x) - sqr(x)) * 4` is repeated. Consider storing the result in a variable and using it for both assignment (if needed) and return, to improve readability and avoid redundant computation.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** The behavior of `sq` and `sqr` functions is not clear from the context. Ensure that these functions are implemented correctly and handle edge cases (e.g., negative numbers, non-integer inputs) as expected.
- **STYLE:** The function name `special` is not descriptive. Consider renaming it to something more meaningful that reflects its purpose or the operation it performs.

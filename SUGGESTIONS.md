### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **[High Priority]** Ensure that the `sq` and `sqr` functions in the `first` module are correctly implemented and do not cause runtime errors. If these functions are not defined or have issues, it will lead to `NameError` or incorrect results.
2. **[Medium Priority]** Validate the input `x` to ensure it is of a type that both `sq` and `sqr` can handle (e.g., numeric types). If `x` is not numeric, it may cause unexpected behavior or errors.
3. **[Low Priority]** Add docstrings or comments to the `special` function to clarify its purpose and expected input/output for better maintainability.

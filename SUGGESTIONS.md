### Suggestions for `main.py`

- **IMPROVEMENT:** The `sqr` function could be renamed to `square` for better readability and alignment with Python's naming conventions.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** Add type hints to the function definitions to improve code clarity and maintainability (e.g., `def sqr(x: int) -> int:`).
- **STYLE:** The variable `a` could be renamed to something more descriptive, such as `number` or `input_value`, to enhance code readability.
- **STYLE:** Add a space around the assignment operator in `a=10` to follow PEP 8 style guidelines (`a = 10`).
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** The `mod` function is defined but not used in the provided code. Consider removing it if unnecessary or adding usage to demonstrate its purpose.

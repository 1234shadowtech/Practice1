### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **[High Severity] [Naming]**: The function name `super` is a reserved keyword in Python and should not be used as a function name. Rename it to something more descriptive and appropriate.
2. **[Medium Severity] [Performance]**: The `super` function calls `sqr(x)` twice, which is inefficient. Store the result of `sqr(x)` in a variable and reuse it.
3. **[Low Severity] [Readability]**: The function name `s` is not descriptive. Rename it to something that reflects its purpose, such as `product_with_remainder`.
4. **[Low Severity] [Commenting]**: The comments are helpful but could be more concise and focused on the purpose of the code rather than restating what the code does.
5. **[Medium Severity] [Error Handling]**: There is no error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values). Consider adding input validation.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[High Severity] [Syntax Error]**: The import statement `from second import super, s` is invalid because `super` is a reserved keyword in Python and cannot be used as an identifier. This will raise a `SyntaxError`.
2. **[Medium Severity] [Module Validation]**: Ensure that the `first` and `second` modules exist and are accessible in the current environment. If they are not valid modules, the code will fail at runtime.
3. **[Low Severity] [Code Readability]**: The variable `b` is defined globally. If this is not intentional, consider encapsulating the logic in a function to avoid polluting the global namespace.
4. **[High Severity] [Runtime Error]**: The line `print(super(b))` will fail at runtime due to the invalid import of `super`. This will prevent the program from executing successfully.
5. **[Low Severity] [Error Handling]**: There is no error handling in the code. If any of the imports or function calls fail, the program will terminate abruptly. Consider adding try-except blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.

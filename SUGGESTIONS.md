### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **[High Severity] [Naming]**: The function name `super` is a reserved keyword in Python and should not be used as a function name. Rename it to something more descriptive and valid, such as `sum_of_squares`.
2. **[Medium Severity] [Performance]**: The `super` function calls `sqr(x)` twice, which is redundant. Store the result of `sqr(x)` in a variable to avoid repeated computation.
3. **[Low Severity] [Readability]**: The function `s` has a very short and non-descriptive name. Rename it to something more meaningful, such as `odd_multiplier`.
4. **[Low Severity] [Comment Clarity]**: The inline comments are helpful but could be more concise and focused on explaining the purpose of the code rather than restating what the code does.
5. **[Medium Severity] [Error Handling]**: There is no error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric inputs). Consider adding input validation to ensure the functions work as expected.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Critical] Invalid Import (`super`):** The `super` keyword is reserved in Python and cannot be used as an identifier. This will cause a syntax error. Consider renaming the function in the `second` module or using a different alias during import.
2. **[Moderate] Module Validation (`first` and `second`):** Ensure that the `first` and `second` modules exist and are correctly implemented. Missing or incorrect modules will result in an `ImportError`.
3. **[Moderate] Error Handling:** Add error handling for the function calls (`sqr`, `super`, `s`) to gracefully handle potential runtime errors (e.g., if the functions are not defined or behave unexpectedly).
4. **[Low] Code Readability:** Add comments or docstrings to explain the purpose of the code and the expected behavior of the imported functions (`sqr`, `super`, `s`).

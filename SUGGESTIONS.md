### Suggestions for `first.py`

1. **[Low Severity] [Naming]**: The function name `sqr` could be more descriptive, such as `square`, to improve code readability and clarity.
2. **[Low Severity] [Type Hinting]**: Adding type hints to the function signature would make the code more explicit and easier to understand for others.
3. **[Low Severity] [Docstring]**: Consider using a proper docstring instead of a comment to describe the function. This is a Python convention and improves documentation.

### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **[High Severity] Naming Conflict**: The function name `super` conflicts with Python's built-in `super()` function. Rename it to avoid confusion and potential issues.
2. **[Medium Severity] Redundant Computation**: In the `super` function, `sqr(x)` is called twice. Store the result in a variable to improve efficiency.
3. **[Low Severity] Lack of Documentation**: The `s` function lacks a docstring, making its purpose unclear. Add a docstring to explain its behavior.
4. **[Low Severity] Readability**: The logic in the `s` function could be made more explicit for better readability, especially for less experienced developers.
5. **[Medium Severity] Dependency Check**: Ensure the `sqr` function in the `first` module is implemented correctly and handles edge cases (e.g., negative numbers, non-integer inputs).

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Critical] Invalid Import Statement**: The `super` keyword is reserved in Python and cannot be used as an identifier. This will cause a `SyntaxError`. Consider renaming the function in the `second` module or using an alias during import.
2. **[Moderate] Missing Context for `first` and `second` Modules**: The code assumes the existence of `first` and `second` modules, but their definitions are not provided. Ensure these modules exist and are correctly implemented.
3. **[Low] Global Variable Usage**: The global variable `b` is used directly in function calls. While this is valid, consider encapsulating the logic in a function or class for better maintainability and readability.
4. **[Moderate] Error Handling**: There is no error handling for cases where the imported functions (`sqr`, `s`, or `super`) might not behave as expected or raise exceptions. Add appropriate error handling mechanisms.
5. **[Low] Code Comments**: While the code is commented, the comments could be more concise and focus on the purpose of each line rather than describing the syntax.

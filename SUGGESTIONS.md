### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **Severity: High | Tag: Bug** - The function `ADD` is called with a single argument `a+b`, but it expects two arguments. This will raise a `TypeError`.
2. **Severity: Medium | Tag: Naming Convention** - The function name `ADD` is in uppercase, which is not consistent with Python's naming conventions. Function names should typically be in lowercase (e.g., `add`).
3. **Severity: Low | Tag: Unused Variables** - The variables `a` and `b` are defined but not used effectively. Their purpose in the code is unclear.
4. **Severity: Low | Tag: Code Clarity** - The code lacks comments or context, making it harder to understand the intent.

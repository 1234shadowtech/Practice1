### Suggestions for `b.py`

1. Rename the function `water` to something more descriptive, such as `calculate_square_root_of_cube`, to improve readability and clarity.  
2. Rename the variable `m` to a more meaningful name, like `cubed_value`, to make the code self-explanatory.  
3. Simplify the logic in the return statement. The current calculation (`m**0.5`) is equivalent to `x * x`. Replace it with `x * x` for better performance and clarity.

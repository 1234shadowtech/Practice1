### Suggestions for `main.py`

- **IMPROVEMENT:** Add type hints to the function definitions for better readability and to ensure type safety. For example, `def sqr(x: int) -> int:` and `def mod(x: int) -> int:`.
- **STYLE:** Use consistent spacing around operators for better readability. For example, `return x * x` instead of `return x*x` and `return x % 10` instead of `return x%10`.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** Add docstrings to the functions instead of inline comments to adhere to Python's best practices for documenting code.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** The variable `a` is hardcoded. Consider making the code more dynamic by allowing user input or passing `a` as an argument to a higher-level function.

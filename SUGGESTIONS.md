### Suggestions for `second.py`

- **BUG:** Ensure that the `sq` and `sqr` functions are correctly implemented in the `first` module. If either function is missing or incorrectly defined, this code will raise an `ImportError` or runtime error.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** The `special` function assumes that `sq(x)` and `sqr(x)` return valid numerical values. If either function returns `None`, raises an exception, or produces unexpected results (e.g., non-numeric values), this could lead to runtime errors or incorrect behavior.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** Add input validation for `x` within the `special` function to ensure it is a valid number (e.g., `int` or `float`). This would prevent issues if `x` is passed as an invalid type.
- **STYLE:** The function `special` could benefit from a docstring to clarify its purpose and expected input/output, especially since it performs mathematical operations.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** If `x` is negative, the behavior of `sqr(x)` (square root) might cause a math domain error unless `sqr` is explicitly designed to handle negative inputs (e.g., by returning complex numbers).

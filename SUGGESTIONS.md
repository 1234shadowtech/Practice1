### Suggestions for `main.py`

- **IMPROVEMENT:** The `substract` function name appears to be misspelled. Consider renaming it to `subtract` for clarity and consistency.
- **STYLE:** The import statements could be grouped together for better readability, as they are currently separated by a blank line.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** The `substract` function and `s` function are imported from external modules (`help` and `special`). Ensure these modules are correctly implemented and available in the runtime environment to avoid import errors.
- **STYLE:** Inline comments explaining variable assignments (`a` and `b`) are redundant, as the code is self-explanatory. Consider removing them to reduce clutter.

### Suggestions for `special.py`

- **BUG:** The `main.py` file imports the `substract` function from the `help` module, but the changed code replaces it with `add`. This could break functionality in `main.py` unless `substract` is still available elsewhere in the `help` module or the dependent code is updated accordingly.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** The `s` function multiplies the result of `add(x, x)` by 2. If `add` is computationally expensive, consider caching or optimizing the operation to avoid redundant calculations.
- **STYLE:** The inline comment in the `s` function could be more concise and focused on explaining the purpose of the function rather than describing the code line-by-line.

### Suggestions for `help.py`

- **IMPROVEMENT:** The function name `substract` is misspelled. The correct spelling is `subtract`. This could lead to confusion or errors if developers expect the standard spelling.
- **STYLE:** Add docstrings to both functions (`add` and `substract`) to provide more detailed explanations of their purpose and usage. This improves code readability and maintainability.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** There is no input validation in either function. If non-numeric values are passed, it could lead to runtime errors. Consider adding type hints or input validation to ensure the functions are used correctly.

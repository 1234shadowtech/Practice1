### Suggestions for `main.py`

- **IMPROVEMENT:** Add type hints to the function definitions for better readability and maintainability (e.g., `def sqr(x: int) -> int:`).
- **STYLE:** Use consistent spacing around operators for better readability (e.g., `return x * x` instead of `return x*x`).
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** The `mod` function is defined but not used. Consider removing it if unnecessary or adding a call to demonstrate its purpose.
- **STYLE:** Variable `a` could have a more descriptive name, such as `input_value`, to improve code clarity.

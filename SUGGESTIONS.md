### Suggestions for `b.py`

1. **Readability**: Add spacing around operators (`*`) for better readability.  
2. **Optimization**: Consider simplifying the calculation `x * x * x` to `x**3` for clarity and consistency with mathematical notation.  
3. **Input Validation**: Ensure the input `x` is validated to avoid unexpected behavior (e.g., non-numeric inputs).  
4. **Naming**: The function name `water` is not descriptive of its purpose. Consider renaming it to something more meaningful, like `cube` or `cube_product`.

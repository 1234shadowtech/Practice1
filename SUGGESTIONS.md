### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Severity: High, Tag: Bug]** The function `SQR_ADD` attempts to calculate the square root of `x` using `x**0.5`. However, if `x` is negative, this will raise a `ValueError` because square roots of negative numbers are not defined for real numbers.
2. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Naming]** The function name `SQR_ADD` is not Pythonic. Function names in Python should follow the snake_case convention, e.g., `sqr_add`.
3. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Readability]** The variable names `a` and `b` are not descriptive. Using more meaningful names would improve code readability.
4. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Input Validation]** The function does not validate its inputs. Adding type checks or ensuring `x` is non-negative would make the function more robust.
5. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Consistency]** The code does not include a main guard (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) to prevent unintended execution when imported as a module.

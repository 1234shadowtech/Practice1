### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Combine NaN and Infinity Checks**: Instead of separate checks for NaN and infinity, use `math.isfinite(x)` to simplify the validation logic. This makes the code cleaner and easier to read.
2. **Improve Error Messages**: Include more consistent and detailed error messages for invalid inputs.
3. **Add Type Validation**: Ensure the input is explicitly a float or can be converted to a float, as the function signature specifies `x: float`.
4. **Optimize Return Logic**: Use a single return statement for the valid cases instead of separate conditional checks for `x == 0` and `x > 0`.
5. **Add Unit Tests**: While not part of the file itself, ensure this function is covered by unit tests to validate edge cases like `x = 0`, `x = NaN`, `x = infinity`, and negative values.

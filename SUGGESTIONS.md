### Suggestions for `first.py`

1. **[High Severity] Function Naming Issue**: The function `sqr` is misleadingly named. It calculates the square root of `x`, not the square. Consider renaming it to `sqrt` for clarity and to align with standard mathematical terminology.
2. **[High Severity] Function Naming Issue**: The function `div` is misleadingly named. It calculates the modulus of `x` by 2, not division. Consider renaming it to `mod2` or something more descriptive.
3. **[Low Severity] Code Readability**: Add docstrings or comments to clarify the purpose of each function for better readability.
4. **[Potential Bug] Dependency Check**: If the dependent code relies on the current function names (`sqr` and `div`), renaming them might break the dependent code. Ensure that all references to these functions in the dependent code are updated accordingly.

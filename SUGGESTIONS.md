### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Function Naming**: The function names `SQr` and `SQ` are not descriptive and do not follow Python's PEP 8 naming conventions. Consider using more descriptive names like `square_root` and `exponential_scaled` for better readability.  
2. **Mathematical Logic in `SQ`**: The function `SQ` computes `(x**x)*5`. This operation can result in extremely large numbers or errors for certain inputs (e.g., negative or fractional values of `x`). Consider adding input validation or handling potential exceptions.  
3. **Division in `car`**: The `car` function uses integer division (`//`). Ensure this is intentional and not a potential source of precision loss. If floating-point division is required, use `/`.  
4. **Unused Variables**: The variable `m` in the `car` function is used only to compute `n`. Consider combining these steps if `m` is not needed elsewhere for clarity.  
5. **Import Usage**: The `water` function is imported from module `b`, but its behavior is not clear from the context. Ensure that `water` is well-documented and tested, as it is a critical dependency in the `car` function.

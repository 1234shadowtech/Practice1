### Suggestions for `c.py`

1. **[High Severity] [Code Clarity]**: The function `SQR` is imported from module `b`, but there is no context or guarantee that `SQR` is defined or behaves as expected. Consider verifying the source of `SQR` or providing a fallback implementation.
2. **[Medium Severity] [Readability]**: The function name `car` is not descriptive. It does not convey the purpose of the function. Consider renaming it to something more meaningful, such as `sum_of_squares`.
3. **[Low Severity] [Code Robustness]**: There is no error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., if `a` or `c` are not numbers). Consider adding input validation to make the function more robust.
4. **[Low Severity] [Code Style]**: The parameter names `a` and `c` are not descriptive. Use more meaningful names to improve code readability.

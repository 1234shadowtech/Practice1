### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[High Severity] Incorrect Function Call**: The function `ADD` is defined to take two arguments, but it is being called with only one argument (`a + b`). This will result in a `TypeError` at runtime.  
   **Fix**: Pass two separate arguments to the function, e.g., `ADD(a, b)`.

2. **[Low Severity] Naming Convention**: The function name `ADD` is in uppercase, which is not consistent with Python's naming conventions (PEP 8). Function names should be in lowercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., `add`).  
   **Fix**: Rename the function to `add`.

3. **[Low Severity] Unused Variables**: The variables `a` and `b` are defined but not directly used in the function call. Instead, their sum (`a + b`) is being passed incorrectly.  
   **Fix**: Use the variables `a` and `b` directly in the function call.

4. **[Low Severity] Missing Docstring**: The function `ADD` lacks a docstring to explain its purpose.  
   **Fix**: Add a docstring to describe the function's behavior.

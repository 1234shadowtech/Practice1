### Suggestions for `b.py`

1. The variable `m` could be renamed to something more descriptive, such as `result` or `squared_value`, to improve code readability.  
2. The function name `water` is not descriptive of its purpose. Consider renaming it to something that reflects its functionality, such as `square` or `calculate_square`.

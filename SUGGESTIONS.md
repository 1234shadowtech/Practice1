### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Severity: High | Tag: Error Handling]**: Add error handling to manage potential issues, such as the `SQr` function not existing, invalid input, or runtime errors.
2. **[Severity: Medium | Tag: Code Readability]**: Use a more descriptive variable name for `a`, such as `number` or `input_value`, to improve code readability.
3. **[Severity: Medium | Tag: Dependency Validation]**: Ensure that the module `a` exists and the `SQr` function is implemented correctly. If the module or function is missing, the code will raise an `ImportError`.
4. **[Severity: Low | Tag: Comments]**: Add a brief description of what the `SQr` function is expected to do (e.g., calculate the square root, square, etc.) for better context.
5. **[Severity: Low | Tag: Best Practices]**: Consider using a `main` function to encapsulate the script logic, which is a common best practice in Python.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Readability]** Use more descriptive variable names instead of `a`. For example, `input_value` or `number` would make the code more readable.
2. **[Severity: High, Tag: Robustness]** Add error handling for the `s` function call to ensure the program doesn't crash if `s` is undefined or raises an exception.
3. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Documentation]** Add a docstring to the `main` function to explain its purpose, parameters, and return value.
4. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Dependency]** Ensure that module `a` exists and contains the function `s`. If `a` is an external dependency, document its purpose and installation requirements.
5. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Testing]** Consider adding test cases to validate the behavior of the `main` function and the `s` function.
6. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Maintainability]** Avoid hardcoding values like `10` directly in the code. Use constants or configuration files for better maintainability.

### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **[High Severity] Inefficient Calculation**: The function calculates `(x**0.5)` three times, which is computationally redundant. This can be optimized by calculating it once and reusing the result.
2. **[Low Severity] Naming Convention**: The function name `s` is not descriptive. It should be renamed to something meaningful that reflects its purpose.
3. **[Medium Severity] Lack of Input Validation**: The function does not validate the input `x`. If `x` is negative, `x**0.5` will result in a complex number, which might not be expected behavior.
4. **[Low Severity] Missing Docstring**: The function lacks a docstring to explain its purpose and expected input/output.

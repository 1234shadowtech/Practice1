### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Naming Improvements**:  
   - Rename `SQr` to `sqrt` or `square_root` for better readability and alignment with standard naming conventions.  
   - Rename `SQ` to something more descriptive, such as `exponential_double`, to clarify its purpose.  
   - Rename `car` to something more meaningful, like `process_water`, to better describe its functionality.  

2. **Potential Overflow in `SQ`**:  
   - The calculation `(x**x)*2` in `SQ` can result in extremely large numbers or overflow errors for large values of `x`. Consider adding input validation or constraints to handle such cases gracefully.  

3. **Integer Division in `car`**:  
   - Ensure that integer division (`//`) in `car` is the intended behavior. If floating-point division is required, replace `//` with `/`.  

4. **Edge Case Handling**:  
   - Verify that the `water` function imported from `b` handles edge cases appropriately, as it is used twice in `car`.

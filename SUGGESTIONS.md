### Suggestions for `second.py`

- **BUG:** The variable `n` is calculated but never used. This is redundant and should be removed unless it serves a purpose in future code.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** The calculation `(sq(x) - sqr(x)) * 4` is repeated twice. Consider storing the result in a variable and returning it to improve readability and efficiency.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** The function `special` assumes that `sq` and `sqr` are correctly implemented and return valid numeric values. If either function raises an exception or returns unexpected types (e.g., `None`), this could lead to runtime errors.
- **STYLE:** The variable name `n` is not descriptive. If it is retained, consider using a more meaningful name to improve code clarity.

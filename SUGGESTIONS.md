### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **[High Severity] Naming Conflict**: The function name `super` conflicts with the built-in `super()` function in Python. This can lead to confusion and potential issues in more complex codebases.
2. **[Medium Severity] Lack of Descriptive Function Names**: The function names `super` and `s` are not descriptive and do not convey their purpose clearly. This reduces code readability and maintainability.
3. **[Low Severity] Missing Type Hints**: The functions lack type hints, which can help with code clarity and debugging in larger projects.
4. **[Low Severity] Missing Docstrings**: The functions do not have docstrings to explain their purpose, inputs, and outputs.
5. **[Medium Severity] Potential Division by Zero**: In the `s` function, the modulo operation (`x % 2`) could result in zero, leading to the function always returning zero for even numbers. This behavior might not be intended.
6. **[Low Severity] Unused Import**: The `sqr` function is imported from `first`, but its implementation is not shown. Ensure that `sqr` is correctly implemented and imported.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[High Severity] [Syntax Error]**: The `import` statement for `super` and `s` is invalid. `super` is a reserved keyword in Python and cannot be used as an identifier. This will raise a `SyntaxError`.
2. **[Medium Severity] [Code Clarity]**: The code does not provide any context or explanation about the `first` and `second` modules. It is unclear what `sqr`, `super`, and `s` are supposed to do.
3. **[Low Severity] [Best Practices]**: The variable `b` is defined globally, which is fine for this small script, but in larger applications, it is better to encapsulate such logic in a function or class.
4. **[Medium Severity] [Error Handling]**: There is no error handling for the imported functions. If `sqr`, `super`, or `s` raise exceptions, the script will terminate abruptly.
5. **[Low Severity] [Code Readability]**: The code lacks comments or documentation to explain its purpose or functionality.

### Suggestions for `first.py`

1. **[Low Severity] [Naming Convention]**: The function name `sqr` is not very descriptive. Consider renaming it to `square` for better readability and alignment with Python's naming conventions.
2. **[Low Severity] [Type Safety]**: The function does not validate the input type. Adding type hints or input validation could make the function more robust.
3. **[Low Severity] [Documentation]**: The function lacks a docstring. Adding a docstring would improve code clarity and maintainability.

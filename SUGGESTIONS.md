### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Naming]** Rename the function `sqr` to `square` for better readability and alignment with Python's naming conventions.
2. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Naming]** Rename the function `small` to something more descriptive, such as `process_special`, to clarify its purpose.
3. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Dependency]** Ensure the `special` function from module `b` is properly documented and its behavior is well understood, as it is a critical dependency.
4. **[Severity: High, Tag: Error Handling]** Add error handling for the `special(x)` function call in `small`. If `special(x)` raises an exception or returns a non-numeric value, the code may fail.
5. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Type Checking]** Add type checking or validation for the input `x` in both functions to ensure it is numeric, preventing unexpected behavior.
6. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Comments]** Improve comments to clarify assumptions and edge cases, such as what happens if `special(x)` returns zero or a negative value.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Severity: High, Tag: Documentation]**: The purpose and functionality of the imported functions (`small`, `sqr`, `special`) are unclear. Add comments or documentation to explain their behavior and expected input/output.
2. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Naming]**: The variable `a` is not descriptive. Consider renaming it to something more meaningful, such as `input_value` or `number`, to improve code readability.
3. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Code Clarity]**: The code lacks context or explanation for why these functions are being called. Add comments to describe the overall purpose of the script.
4. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Error Handling]**: There is no error handling for the function calls. If the imported functions have specific requirements (e.g., `a` must be a number), consider adding validation or try-except blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.

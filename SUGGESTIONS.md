### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **[High | Naming]**: The function name `super` is a reserved keyword in Python and should not be used as a function name. Rename it to something more descriptive, such as `sum_of_squares`.
2. **[Medium | Efficiency]**: The `super` function calls `sqr(x)` twice, which is inefficient. Store the result of `sqr(x)` in a variable and reuse it.
3. **[Low | Readability]**: The function name `s` is not descriptive. Rename it to something meaningful, such as `product_with_remainder`.
4. **[Low | Commenting]**: The comments are helpful but could be more concise and aligned with the code's purpose.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[High Severity] Invalid Import**: The `super` keyword is reserved in Python and cannot be used as an identifier. This will cause a syntax error. Consider renaming the function in the `second` module or using a valid identifier for import.
2. **[Medium Severity] Module Validation**: Ensure that the `first` and `second` modules exist and are correctly implemented. Missing or incorrect modules will result in an `ImportError`.
3. **[Low Severity] Global Variable Usage**: The global variable `b` is used directly without any encapsulation or validation. Consider wrapping it in a function or class for better maintainability and scope control.
4. **[Medium Severity] Error Handling**: There is no error handling for the function calls (`sqr`, `super`, `s`). If any of these functions fail, the program will terminate. Add try-except blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.
5. **[Low Severity] Code Readability**: Add comments or docstrings to explain the purpose of the code and the expected behavior of the imported functions.

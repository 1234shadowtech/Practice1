### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **Bug Severity: High**  
   - The `special` function in the changed code is using `sq` and `sqr` functions, which are imported from the `first` module. Ensure that both `sq` and `sqr` are correctly defined and implemented in the `first` module. If they are not defined or have issues, this will cause runtime errors when `special` is called.

2. **Code Duplication: Medium**  
   - The calculation `(sq(x) - sqr(x)) * 5` is repeated twice in the `special` function. This is unnecessary and can be optimized by storing the result in a variable and returning it directly.

3. **Function Naming: Low**  
   - The name `special` is generic and does not convey the purpose of the function. Consider renaming it to something more descriptive based on its functionality.

4. **Dependent Code Compatibility: High**  
   - The dependent code calls `special(a)`. Ensure that the `sq` and `sqr` functions are compatible with the input `a` (an integer in this case). If `sq` or `sqr` expect a different type, this will cause a bug.

### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Optimize Imports**: The `math` module import should be moved to the top of the file to follow Python's PEP 8 guidelines for import organization.
2. **Improve Error Messages**: The error messages could be more concise and avoid redundancy. For example, combining the checks for non-finite and negative values into a single message.
3. **Clarify Docstring**: The docstring could be improved to clarify that the function does not actually calculate a square root or ratio, which might be misleading based on the function name.
4. **Type Hinting**: The type hint for the parameter `x` is correct, but the function could benefit from stricter type validation (e.g., explicitly checking for `float` or `int`).
5. **Edge Case Testing**: Consider adding a comment to highlight that the function assumes `x` is already validated as a number before being passed in, as the current implementation does not handle strings or other invalid types gracefully.

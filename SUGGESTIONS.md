### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **Hardcoded Values**: The variables `a` and `b` are hardcoded in the `main` function. Consider accepting these values as user input or command-line arguments to make the program more dynamic and reusable.  
2. **Type Hints and Docstrings**: Adding type hints and docstrings to the `main` function would improve code readability and maintainability.  
3. **Error Handling**: There is no error handling for potential issues like invalid inputs (if the code is later modified to accept user input). Adding basic validation or try-except blocks would make the program more robust.  
4. **Code Comments**: While the comments are helpful, some are redundant (e.g., "Printing the result of addition"). Consider removing overly obvious comments to reduce clutter.

### Suggestions for `operations/advanced.py`

1. **Performance Optimization**: The `multiply` function uses repeated addition to calculate the product, which is inefficient for large values of `b`. Consider using Python's built-in multiplication operator (`*`) for better performance.  
2. **Naming Consistency**: The function names `multiply` and `power` are clear, but adding docstrings to describe their purpose and usage would improve code readability and maintainability.  
3. **Edge Case Handling**: Neither function handles edge cases explicitly, such as negative values for `b` in `multiply` or `exponent` in `power`. Consider adding validation or documentation for expected input ranges.  
4. **Import Clarity**: The `add` function is imported from `operations.basic`, but its implementation is not visible here. Ensure that `add` is robust and handles edge cases like overflow or invalid inputs.

### Suggestions for `operations/basic.py`

1. Add type hints to both functions to improve code readability and maintainability. For example, specify the expected input types and return type.  
2. Include docstrings for both functions to describe their purpose, parameters, and return values. This will make the code more self-explanatory and easier to understand for other developers.

### Suggestions for `utilities/validator.py`

1. The function names `is_positive` and `is_even` are clear, but you might consider adding type hints for better readability and to ensure type safety. For example, `def is_positive(number: int) -> bool:`.  
2. Adding docstrings to the functions would improve code documentation and make it easier for other developers to understand their purpose.  
3. Consider adding input validation to handle unexpected data types, which could prevent runtime errors. For example, checking if `number` is an integer or float before performing operations.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

- **IMPROVEMENT:** The function name `sqr` could be more descriptive, such as `square`, to improve readability and clarity.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** The function name `mod` could be more descriptive, such as `modulus_of_two`, to better convey its purpose.
- **STYLE:** Add type hints to the function definitions to improve code readability and maintainability. For example, `def sqr(x: int) -> int:`.
- **STYLE:** Add a docstring to each function to provide a more detailed explanation of its purpose and usage.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** The variable `a` is hardcoded as `10`. If this is for demonstration purposes, consider adding a comment to clarify or making it user-configurable for better flexibility.

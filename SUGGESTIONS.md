### Suggestions for `main.py`

- **IMPROVEMENT:** The `sqr` function is defined but not used in the `changed_code`. If it is unnecessary, consider removing it to avoid dead code.
- **STYLE:** The `sqr` function could use a more descriptive name, such as `square`, to improve readability and align with Python's naming conventions.
- **STYLE:** The `mod` function could use a more descriptive name, such as `modulus_of_two`, to clarify its purpose.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** The `mod` function assumes the input is an integer. If `x` is a float or another type, it may lead to unexpected behavior. Consider adding type hints or input validation.
- **STYLE:** The variable `a` could use a more descriptive name, such as `number`, to improve code clarity.

### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **[Moderate] Naming Convention**: 
   - Rename `sqr` to `square` for better readability and alignment with Python's naming conventions.
   - Rename `small` to something more descriptive, such as `process_special`, to clarify its purpose.

2. **[High] Dependency Clarity**: 
   - Ensure the `special` function from module `b` is well-documented and its behavior is understood. If `special` is not available or its behavior changes, this code will break.

3. **[Moderate] Error Handling**: 
   - Add error handling for `special(x)` to ensure it returns a value that can be safely divided by 2. For example, if `special(x)` returns `None` or a non-numeric value, the code will raise an exception.

4. **[Low] Code Comments**: 
   - Add more detailed comments to explain the purpose of each function and its expected input/output.

5. **[Low] Type Hinting**: 
   - Add type hints to the function definitions to improve code readability and maintainability.

### Suggestions for `b.py`

1. **Redundancy (Medium)**: The square root of `x` is calculated twice, which is unnecessary and can be optimized for better performance.
2. **Naming (Low)**: The function name `special` is not descriptive. A more meaningful name would improve code readability.
3. **Input Validation (Medium)**: The function does not validate the input. If `x` is negative, the code will raise a `ValueError` due to the invalid square root operation.
4. **Code Commenting (Low)**: The comment is helpful but could be more concise and precise.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Severity: Medium | Tag: Readability]**: The variable `a` is not descriptive. Use a more meaningful name to improve code readability.
2. **[Severity: High | Tag: Context]**: The purpose of the imported functions (`small`, `sqr`, `special`) and their respective modules (`a`, `b`) is unclear. Add comments or documentation to explain their functionality.
3. **[Severity: Medium | Tag: Dependency Management]**: If the modules `a` and `b` are external dependencies, ensure they are properly documented and installed in the environment.
4. **[Severity: Low | Tag: Error Handling]**: There is no error handling for the function calls. If any of the functions throw an exception, the program will terminate abruptly.
5. **[Severity: Low | Tag: Code Comments]**: Add comments to explain the purpose of the code and its expected behavior for better maintainability.

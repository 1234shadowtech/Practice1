### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Severity: Medium] [Tag: Naming]**: Variables `a` and `m` have non-descriptive names. Consider renaming them to something more meaningful, such as `num1` and `num2`, to improve code readability.
2. **[Severity: High] [Tag: Dependency]**: Ensure that the modules `a`, `c`, and `yes` are available and properly documented. Missing or undocumented modules can lead to runtime errors or confusion for other developers.
3. **[Severity: Medium] [Tag: Error Handling]**: Verify that the functions `ADD`, `SUB`, `car`, and `loop` handle edge cases (e.g., invalid inputs, type mismatches) gracefully. Add error handling if necessary.
4. **[Severity: Low] [Tag: Comments]**: While the code is functional, adding comments to explain the purpose of each function call and its expected behavior would improve maintainability.
5. **[Severity: Medium] [Tag: Testing]**: Ensure that the functions `ADD`, `SUB`, `car`, and `loop` are covered by unit tests to validate their behavior with various inputs.
6. **[Severity: Low] [Tag: Formatting]**: Consider aligning the code for better readability, especially if the code grows larger.

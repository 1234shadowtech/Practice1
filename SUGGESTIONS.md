### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **[High Severity] Redundant Calculation**: The expression `(sq(x) - sqr(x)) * 2` is calculated twice in the `special` function. This redundancy can lead to unnecessary computational overhead. Consider storing the result of `sq(x) - sqr(x)` in a variable and reusing it.
2. **[Medium Severity] Missing Context Validation**: Ensure that the `sq` and `sqr` functions are correctly implemented in the `first` module and return the expected results. If these functions are not implemented or have issues, it could lead to runtime errors.
3. **[Low Severity] Code Readability**: The `special` function could benefit from better variable naming. For example, `m` is defined but not used, which might confuse readers. Either use `m` or remove it entirely.

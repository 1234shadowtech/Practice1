### Suggestions for `b.py`

1. Replace `x * x * x` with `x**3` for better readability and efficiency.  
2. Rename the function `water` to something more descriptive, such as `cube_root` or `sqrt_of_cube`, to better reflect its purpose.  
3. Add type hints to the function signature to improve code clarity and maintainability. For example: `def water(x: float) -> float:`.  
4. Consider adding input validation to ensure `x` is a valid number (e.g., not `None` or a non-numeric type).

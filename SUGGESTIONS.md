### Suggestions for `first.py`

1. **Bug - High Severity**: The function `div(x)` is incorrectly named and implemented. Based on the name, it suggests division, but the implementation performs a modulus operation (`x % 2`). This could lead to confusion or unintended behavior in dependent code.
2. **Improvement - Medium Severity**: The function `sqr(x)` could be renamed to `sqrt(x)` for better clarity, as it calculates the square root of `x`. This aligns with common mathematical terminology.
3. **Improvement - Low Severity**: Add docstrings to all functions to improve code readability and maintainability.

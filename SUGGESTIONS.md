### Suggestions for `second.py`

- **BUG:** The `special` function redundantly calculates `(sq(x) - sqr(x)) * 2` twice, which is inefficient and could lead to performance issues if `sq` or `sqr` are computationally expensive. Store the result in a variable and reuse it.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** The `special` function could benefit from a docstring to clarify its purpose and expected input/output.
- **STYLE:** The `special` function lacks proper spacing around operators, which is against PEP 8 style guidelines. For example, `n = (sq(x) - sqr(x)) * 2` should have spaces around the `-` and `*` operators for better readability.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** Ensure that `sq` and `sqr` are defined and imported correctly from the `first` module, and verify their behavior for edge cases (e.g., negative numbers, zero, or non-integer inputs).

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[High Severity] [SyntaxError]**: The import statement `from second import super, s` is invalid because `super` is a reserved keyword in Python and cannot be used as an identifier. This will cause a `SyntaxError` and prevent the code from running.
2. **[Medium Severity] [Code Clarity]**: The code does not handle potential exceptions or errors that might occur if the imported functions (`sqr`, `s`) are not defined or behave unexpectedly.
3. **[Low Severity] [Code Readability]**: The code lacks comments explaining the purpose of the `sqr` and `s` functions, making it harder for others to understand the intent of the code.
4. **[Low Severity] [Best Practices]**: The variable `b` is defined as a global variable. While this is not inherently wrong, it is generally better to encapsulate such logic within a function or class to improve modularity and maintainability.

### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **[High Severity] Naming Conflict**: The function name `super` conflicts with the built-in `super()` function in Python. This can lead to confusion and potential issues in more complex codebases. Consider renaming the function to something more descriptive, such as `sum_of_squares`.
2. **[Medium Severity] Redundant Computation**: In the `super` function, the `sqr(x)` function is called twice with the same argument. This is inefficient, especially if `sqr` is computationally expensive. Store the result of `sqr(x)` in a variable and reuse it.
3. **[Low Severity] Lack of Documentation**: The purpose of the `s` function is unclear without additional context. Add a docstring to explain its intended behavior and use case.
4. **[Low Severity] Import Validation**: Ensure that the `sqr` function from the `first` module is implemented correctly and handles edge cases (e.g., negative numbers, non-integer inputs) as expected.
5. **[Low Severity] Code Readability**: The `s` function's logic could be made more explicit for better readability. For example, use a conditional expression to clarify the behavior for even and odd numbers.

### Suggestions for `first.py`

1. **[Low Severity] [Naming]**: The function name `sqr` is not very descriptive. Consider renaming it to `square` for better readability and clarity.
2. **[Low Severity] [Type Hinting]**: The function lacks type hints. Adding type hints can improve code readability and help with static analysis tools.
3. **[Low Severity] [Docstring]**: The function lacks a proper docstring. Adding a docstring would make the function more self-explanatory.

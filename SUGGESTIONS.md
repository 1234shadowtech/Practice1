### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **[High Severity] [Naming]**: The function name `super` is a reserved keyword in Python and should not be used as a function name. This can lead to confusion and potential issues in the code.
2. **[Medium Severity] [Efficiency]**: The `super` function calls `sqr(x)` twice, which is redundant. The result of `sqr(x)` can be stored in a variable to avoid duplicate computation.
3. **[Low Severity] [Readability]**: The function `s` has a cryptic name that does not convey its purpose. Consider renaming it to something more descriptive, such as `product_with_remainder`.
4. **[Low Severity] [Comment Clarity]**: The inline comments are helpful but could be more concise and focused on explaining the purpose of the code rather than restating what the code does.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[High Severity] [Syntax Error]**: The import statement `from second import super, s` is invalid because `super` is a reserved keyword in Python and cannot be used as an identifier. This will result in a `SyntaxError`.
2. **[Medium Severity] [Module Validation]**: Ensure that the `first` and `second` modules exist and are accessible in the current environment. If they are not valid modules, the code will raise an `ImportError`.
3. **[Low Severity] [Code Clarity]**: The variable `b` is defined globally. If this code is part of a larger script, consider encapsulating it in a function to avoid polluting the global namespace.
4. **[High Severity] [Runtime Error]**: The line `print(super(b))` will fail due to the invalid import of `super`. This will cause the program to terminate at runtime.
5. **[Low Severity] [Error Handling]**: There is no error handling in the code. If any of the imports or function calls fail, the program will crash. Consider adding try-except blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.

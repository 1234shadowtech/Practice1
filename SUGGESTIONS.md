### Suggestions for `app.py`

- **STYLE:** The function name `Sq` could be more descriptive. Consider renaming it to `square` for better readability and adherence to Python naming conventions.
- **STYLE:** Add a docstring to the `Sq` function to describe its purpose and expected input/output.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** The variable `a` is defined without context. Consider adding a comment or renaming it to something more meaningful, like `number_to_square`.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** Type hints are used in the function definition, which is good practice. However, consider adding runtime validation for the input type to ensure robustness.

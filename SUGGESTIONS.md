### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **[Severity: Low] [Tag: Readability]** - The function names `sqr` and `small` are not descriptive enough. Consider renaming them to something more meaningful, such as `square` and `process_special`, to improve code readability.
2. **[Severity: Medium] [Tag: Dependency]** - The `special` function is imported from module `b`, but there is no context provided about the `b` module. Ensure that the `b` module is available and properly documented.
3. **[Severity: Medium] [Tag: Error Handling]** - The `small` function assumes that `special(x)` will always return a value that can be divided by 2 without any issues. Consider adding error handling to manage unexpected inputs or outputs from `special`.
4. **[Severity: Low] [Tag: Type Safety]** - The code does not validate the type of `x` in either function. Adding type hints and input validation would make the code more robust.
5. **[Severity: Low] [Tag: Testing]** - There are no tests provided for these functions. Consider adding unit tests to ensure the correctness of the code.

### Suggestions for `b.py`

1. **[Severity: Low] [Tag: Readability]** - The function name `special` is not descriptive. It does not convey the purpose or functionality of the code. Consider renaming it to something more meaningful, such as `calculate_double_square_root`.
2. **[Severity: Low] [Tag: Optimization]** - The square root of `x` is calculated twice, which is redundant. This can be optimized by calculating it once and reusing the result.
3. **[Severity: Medium] [Tag: Validation]** - The function does not handle invalid inputs, such as negative numbers, which would result in a `ValueError` when calculating the square root. Consider adding input validation or handling such cases.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[High Severity] [Code Clarity]**: The imports `small`, `sqr`, and `special` are not descriptive enough. It is unclear what these functions do or what modules `a` and `b` represent. Consider using more descriptive module names or adding comments to clarify their purpose.
2. **[Medium Severity] [Error Handling]**: There is no error handling in the code. If any of the imported functions or modules are missing, or if they raise exceptions, the script will fail without providing meaningful feedback.
3. **[Low Severity] [Code Style]**: The variable `a` is used as both a module name (`from a import ...`) and a variable name (`a=10`). This can lead to confusion and should be avoided by using a more descriptive variable name.
4. **[Low Severity] [Code Style]**: The code lacks comments explaining its purpose or functionality. Adding comments would improve readability and maintainability.

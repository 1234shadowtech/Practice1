### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Low | Consistency]**: Ensure consistent casing in the output strings for better readability and uniformity. For example, use "Hi" and "Bye" instead of "HI" and "bye".
2. **[Low | Readability]**: Add a brief comment at the top of the code to describe its purpose, even for simple scripts, to improve maintainability.

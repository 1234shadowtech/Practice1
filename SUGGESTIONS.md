### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **[High Severity] [Bug]**: The formula used in the function is incorrect. The function is supposed to calculate the square root of `x`, but it instead multiplies `x` by the square root of `x`. The correct formula should be `x**0.5`.
2. **[Low Severity] [Naming]**: The function name `SSqr` is not descriptive or aligned with Python's naming conventions (PEP 8). A more appropriate name would be `calculate_square_root` or `sqrt`.
3. **[Low Severity] [Documentation]**: The function lacks a proper docstring to explain its purpose and usage.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Severity: High] [Tag: Dependency]**: Ensure that the module `a` exists and is accessible in the current environment. If the module is missing or incorrectly named, the code will raise an `ImportError`.
2. **[Severity: Medium] [Tag: Naming]**: The variable `a` shares the same name as the module being imported. This can lead to confusion and should be renamed to something more descriptive, such as `input_value`.
3. **[Severity: Medium] [Tag: Function Validation]**: Verify that the `SSqr` function is implemented correctly in module `a` and that it accepts the expected input type (in this case, an integer).
4. **[Severity: Low] [Tag: Readability]**: Add a docstring or comment at the top of the script to explain the purpose of the code for better readability and maintainability.

### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Function Naming**: The function names `SQr` and `SQ` do not follow PEP 8 naming conventions. Consider renaming them to `sqrt` and `square_power` or similar descriptive names in lowercase with underscores.  
2. **Error Handling**: The `SQ` function can produce extremely large numbers or errors (e.g., for negative or non-integer inputs). Consider adding input validation or error handling to prevent runtime issues.  
3. **Integer Division in `car`**: The use of `n // 2` in the `car` function truncates the result. If truncation is not explicitly required, consider using regular division (`n / 2`) to avoid unintended data loss.  
4. **Dependency on `water`**: The `car` function heavily relies on the `water` function from module `b`. Ensure that `water` is well-tested and handles edge cases, as its behavior directly impacts `car`.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Naming]** Variable names `a` and `b` are not descriptive. Use more meaningful names like `num1` and `num2` to improve code readability.
2. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Naming]** The function name `ADD` does not follow PEP 8 naming conventions. Use lowercase letters with underscores, such as `add`.
3. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Documentation]** The function `ADD` lacks a docstring. Adding a docstring would clarify its purpose and usage.
4. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Readability]** Inline comments are helpful but could be more concise and focused on the "why" rather than the "what."
5. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Consistency]** The code could benefit from consistent formatting, such as adding a blank line before the function definition for better readability.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **Hardcoded Values**: The variables `a` and `b` are hardcoded in the `main` function. Consider replacing them with user input or configurable parameters to make the program more dynamic.  
2. **Type Hints**: Adding type hints to the function definitions (e.g., `main()`) would improve code readability and maintainability.  
3. **Docstrings**: The `main` function lacks a docstring. Adding one would clarify its purpose and usage.  
4. **Validation**: While utility functions like `is_positive` and `is_even` are used, there is no validation for the hardcoded values `a` and `b`. Consider validating these values before performing operations.  
5. **Logging**: Replace `print` statements with a logging mechanism for better control over output, especially in production environments.

### Suggestions for `operations/advanced.py`

1. **Optimization**: The `multiply` function uses repeated addition to calculate the product, which is inefficient for large values of `b`. Consider using Python's built-in multiplication operator (`*`) for better performance.  
2. **Naming**: The function names `multiply` and `power` are clear, but adding docstrings to explain their purpose and usage would improve code readability.  
3. **Edge Cases**: Ensure that the `multiply` and `power` functions handle edge cases like negative numbers, zero, and large values gracefully. For example, multiplying by zero or raising a number to the power of zero should return correct results.  
4. **Testing**: Verify that the imported `add` function from `operations.basic` handles edge cases correctly, as its behavior directly impacts the correctness of `multiply`.

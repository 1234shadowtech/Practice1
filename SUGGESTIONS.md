### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Function Naming**: The function name `s` is not descriptive. Use a more meaningful name to indicate the purpose of the function.
2. **Division by Zero**: The current implementation does not handle the case where `x` is `0`. This will result in a `ZeroDivisionError`.
3. **Floating Point Precision**: The use of `x**0.5` for square root calculation is valid but could lead to floating-point precision issues. Consider using the `math.sqrt` function for better readability and precision.
4. **Return Value**: The function always returns `1.0` for valid inputs (since `(x**0.5) // (x**0.5)` simplifies to `1.0` for `x > 0`). This behavior should be clarified or adjusted if unintended.
5. **Input Validation**: Add input validation to ensure `x` is a non-negative number, as square root operations are undefined for negative numbers in the real domain.
6. **Documentation**: Add a docstring to explain the purpose of the function, its parameters, and its return value.

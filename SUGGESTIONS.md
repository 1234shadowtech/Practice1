### Suggestions for `second.py`

- **BUG:** The variable `m` is defined but never used. This is redundant and should be removed to avoid confusion.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** The calculation `(sq(x) - sqr(x)) * 2` is repeated twice (once for `m` and once for the return statement). Removing the unused variable `m` will simplify the code and improve readability.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** Ensure that both `sq` and `sqr` functions are implemented correctly and handle edge cases, such as negative or zero values for `x`, as their behavior is not clear from the context.
- **STYLE:** The function name `special` is vague and does not convey its purpose. Consider renaming it to something more descriptive, such as `calculate_difference` or `scaled_difference`.
- **STYLE:** Inline comments explaining the logic of the calculation `(sq(x) - sqr(x)) * 2` would improve code readability for future developers.

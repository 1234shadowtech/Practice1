### Suggestions for `b.py`

1. The function name `water` is not descriptive of its purpose. Consider renaming it to something more meaningful, such as `calculate_square_root_of_cube` or similar.  
2. The variable name `x` is too generic. Use a more descriptive name, such as `input_value` or `number`.  
3. The logic in the function is redundant. Since `m` is `x * x * x` and then the square root of `m` is taken, the result is equivalent to `x * x`. Simplify the function to avoid unnecessary calculations.  
4. Ensure the function has a docstring to explain its purpose and expected input/output.

### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Severity: Low | Tag: Naming Conventions**  
   - The function names `ADD` and `SUB` are in uppercase, which does not follow PEP 8 naming conventions. Function names should be in lowercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., `add`, `sub`).

2. **Severity: Medium | Tag: Logic/Clarity**  
   - The `SUB` function subtracts `a` from `b` (`b - a`), which is unconventional and may confuse users. Typically, subtraction functions are expected to return `a - b`. If this behavior is intentional, it should be clearly documented.

3. **Severity: Low | Tag: Documentation**  
   - The functions lack detailed docstrings. Adding docstrings would improve code readability and help users understand the purpose and behavior of the functions.

4. **Severity: Low | Tag: Readability**  
   - The code could benefit from consistent spacing and formatting to improve readability.

### Suggestions for `b.py`

1. **[High Severity] [Naming Convention]**: The function name `SQR` is misleading as it implies the function calculates the square of a number, but it actually calculates the fourth power. Rename the function to something more descriptive, such as `fourth_power` or `power_four`.
2. **[Medium Severity] [PEP 8 Compliance]**: The function name `SQR` does not follow PEP 8 naming conventions for function names, which recommend using lowercase letters with words separated by underscores (e.g., `fourth_power`).
3. **[Low Severity] [Documentation]**: The function lacks a docstring to explain its purpose and behavior. Adding a docstring would improve code readability and maintainability.

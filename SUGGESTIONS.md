### Suggestions for `main.py`

- **IMPROVEMENT:** The import statement for `substract` has a potential typo. The correct spelling might be `subtract`. Verify the function name in the `help` module to ensure it matches.
- **STYLE:** Consider adding a brief comment explaining the purpose of the script or the logic behind using `s` and `substract` for better readability.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** The `substract` function's behavior is unclear without context. Ensure it handles edge cases like non-numeric inputs or unexpected values gracefully.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** The `s` function's purpose is ambiguous. If it performs critical operations, ensure it is well-documented and tested for reliability.

### Suggestions for `special.py`

- **BUG:** The `s` function's description in the comment is slightly misleading. It states "doubles the sum of 'x' added to itself," which could be interpreted as `(x + x) * 2`. However, the actual implementation is `add(x, x) * 2`. If the `add` function has any custom behavior (e.g., logging, validation), this distinction matters. Clarify the comment to reflect the actual implementation.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** The `add` function is imported but its behavior is not verified in the context of this code. Ensure that `add` is correctly implemented and handles edge cases (e.g., non-numeric inputs) since it is critical to the functionality of `s`.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** The change from `substract` to `add` in the import statement might break dependent code in `main.py`, as `substract` is explicitly used there. Verify that this change aligns with the intended functionality and does not introduce regressions.
- **STYLE:** The inline comment for the `s` function could be more concise and precise to avoid confusion. For example, "Returns twice the result of adding 'x' to itself using the 'add' function."

### Suggestions for `help.py`

- **BUG:** The function name `substract` is misspelled. The correct spelling is `subtract`. This could lead to confusion or errors if developers expect the standard spelling.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** Add type hints to the function definitions to improve code readability and ensure type safety. For example, `def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:` and `def subtract(a: int, b: int) -> int:`.
- **STYLE:** Add docstrings to both functions to provide more detailed explanations of their purpose and usage. This is especially useful for larger projects or shared codebases.
- **STYLE:** Consider adding input validation (e.g., checking if `a` and `b` are numbers) to make the functions more robust and prevent unexpected behavior.

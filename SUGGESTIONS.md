### Suggestions for `first.py`

- **BUG:** The `sqr` function name suggests it calculates the square of a number, but it actually calculates the square root. Consider renaming the function to `sqrt` for clarity and accuracy.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** The `mod` function lacks a clear name. Consider renaming it to something more descriptive, such as `modulus_of_two`, to improve readability and understanding.
- **STYLE:** Add docstrings to both functions to clarify their purpose and expected input/output. This will improve maintainability and usability for other developers.

### Suggestions for `second.py`

- **BUG:** The expression `x**x` can lead to a `ValueError` or `OverflowError` for certain values of `x` (e.g., negative numbers or large values). Consider adding input validation or handling these exceptions.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** The function `special` lacks a docstring. Adding a docstring would improve code readability and maintainability by explaining its purpose and expected input/output.
- **STYLE:** The naming of the function `special` is vague. Consider using a more descriptive name that reflects its functionality.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** The behavior of `mod(x)` is unclear without context from the `first` module. Ensure that `mod` handles edge cases appropriately, especially if `x` can be negative or non-integer.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

- **IMPROVEMENT:** Add comments to clarify the purpose of the `sqr` and `special` functions, especially since they are imported from external modules. This will help future developers understand their usage without needing to inspect the modules.
- **STYLE:** Use more descriptive variable names instead of `a` to improve code readability. For example, `number` or `input_value` could be more meaningful.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** Ensure that the `sqr` and `special` functions handle edge cases (e.g., negative numbers, non-integer inputs) appropriately, as their behavior is not clear from the context provided. This might require validation before calling these functions.

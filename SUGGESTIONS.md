- **IMPROVEMENT:** The `sqr` function could use a more descriptive name, such as `square`, to improve readability and clarity.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** The `mod` function is defined but not used in the provided code. Consider removing it if unnecessary or adding usage to demonstrate its purpose.
- **STYLE:** The variable `a` could be renamed to something more descriptive, such as `number`, to enhance code readability.
- **STYLE:** Add spaces around the `*` operator in the `sqr` function for better readability (`x * x` instead of `x*x`).

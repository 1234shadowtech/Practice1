### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Function Name**: The function name `calculate_ratio_of_square_root` is misleading because the calculation always returns `1.0`. Consider renaming it to something more descriptive, such as `validate_positive_input` or `check_positive_input_and_return_constant`.
2. **Docstring Clarity**: The docstring mentions a calculation, but the function does not perform any meaningful computation. Update the docstring to reflect the actual behavior of the function.
3. **Type Hint for Return**: Since the function always returns `1.0`, consider using `Literal[1.0]` from the `typing` module to make the return type more precise.
4. **Validation Message**: The error message could be more specific, e.g., "Input must be a positive float greater than zero."
5. **Performance**: The function is trivial and could be replaced with a simple validation utility if the constant return value is unnecessary.

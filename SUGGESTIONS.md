### Suggestions for `main.py`

- **IMPROVEMENT:** The function `sqr` could benefit from a more descriptive name, such as `square`, to improve readability and clarity.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** The function `mod` could also use a more descriptive name, such as `modulus_with_2` or `is_odd`, depending on its intended use.
- **STYLE:** Add spaces around operators (`*` and `%`) to improve code readability, as per PEP 8 guidelines.
- **STYLE:** The variable `a` could be renamed to something more descriptive, such as `input_value`, to make the code more self-explanatory.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** The `mod` function is defined but not used in the provided code. If it is not needed, consider removing it to avoid confusion.

### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **Severity: High** - Ensure that the `first` module exists and contains the `sq` and `sqr` functions. If the module or functions are missing, the code will raise an `ImportError` or `AttributeError`.
2. **Severity: High** - Verify that the `sq` and `sqr` functions handle the input `x` correctly. If these functions are not implemented properly, it could lead to runtime errors or incorrect results.
3. **Severity: Medium** - Add input validation for the `special` function to ensure `x` is of a type that `sq` and `sqr` can process (e.g., numeric types). This will prevent unexpected behavior or errors.
4. **Severity: Low** - Consider adding docstrings to the `special` function for better code readability and maintainability.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **Severity: High** - Ensure the `div` function in the `first` module is implemented correctly and handles edge cases such as division by zero or invalid input types. If the function is not robust, it may cause runtime errors.
2. **Severity: High** - Ensure the `special` function in the `second` module is implemented correctly and handles edge cases such as invalid input types. If the function is not robust, it may cause runtime errors.
3. **Severity: Medium** - The variable `a` could be given a more descriptive name to improve code readability and maintainability. For example, `input_value` or `number_to_process`.
4. **Severity: Low** - Verify that both `first` and `second` modules exist and are correctly imported. If the modules are missing or incorrectly named, the code will fail at runtime.
5. **Severity: Low** - Ensure that the `div` and `special` functions are designed to handle the expected input type (integer in this case). If they expect a different type, the code may fail.

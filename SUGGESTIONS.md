### Suggestions for `yes.py`

[CRITICAL] ⚠️

- [CRITICAL] The variable `n` is used in the loop without being initialized. This will raise an `UnboundLocalError` when the function is executed. `n` must be initialized before it is used.
- [STYLE] The function name `loop` is too generic and does not convey the purpose of the function. Consider renaming it to something more descriptive, such as `sum_of_integers`.
- [PERFORMANCE] If the goal is to calculate the sum of integers from 0 to `x-1`, this can be done more efficiently using the formula `n = x * (x - 1) // 2` instead of iterating through a loop.
- [STYLE] Add a docstring to explain the purpose of the function, its parameters, and its return value.
- [STYLE] Use type hints to make the function signature more explicit and improve code readability.

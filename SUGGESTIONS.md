### Suggestions for `second.py`

1. **[High Severity] [Naming]**: The function name `super` is problematic because it shadows the built-in `super()` function in Python. This can lead to confusion and potential issues in more complex codebases.
2. **[Medium Severity] [Performance]**: In the `super` function, the `sqr(x)` function is called twice with the same argument. This is inefficient if `sqr(x)` is computationally expensive. Consider storing the result in a variable to avoid redundant computation.
3. **[Low Severity] [Readability]**: The function names `super` and `s` are not descriptive. They do not convey the purpose of the functions clearly, which can make the code harder to understand and maintain.
4. **[Low Severity] [Commenting]**: While the comments are present, they could be more concise and aligned with Python's convention of explaining "why" rather than "what" the code does.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[High Severity] Invalid Import**: The `super` keyword is reserved in Python and cannot be used as an identifier. This will cause a syntax error. Consider renaming the function or variable in the `second` module.
2. **[Medium Severity] Module Validation**: Ensure that the `first` and `second` modules exist and are correctly implemented. Missing or incorrect modules will cause an `ImportError`.
3. **[Low Severity] Global Variable Usage**: Using a global variable (`b`) directly in function calls can lead to less maintainable code. Consider encapsulating the logic in a function or passing `b` explicitly.
4. **[Low Severity] Error Handling**: There is no error handling for the function calls. If `sqr`, `super`, or `s` raise exceptions, the program will terminate abruptly. Add try-except blocks for robustness.

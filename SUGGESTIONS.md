### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Function Naming**: The function names `SQr` and `SQ` do not follow PEP 8 naming conventions, which recommend using lowercase with underscores (e.g., `sqr` and `sq`). Consider renaming these functions for better readability and consistency.  
2. **Input Validation**:  
   - The `SQ` function can produce extremely large numbers or raise exceptions (e.g., `OverflowError`) for certain inputs, such as negative numbers or very large values. Consider adding input validation or documenting the expected input range.  
   - Similarly, the `SQr` function does not handle negative inputs, which would result in a `ValueError`. Adding input checks or documenting the expected input type would improve robustness.  
3. **Integer Division in `car`**: The `car` function uses integer division (`//`) to return the result. If floating-point precision is required, consider using regular division (`/`) instead. Clarify the intended behavior in the documentation or comments.  
4. **Dependency on `water`**: The `car` function heavily relies on the `water` function from module `b`. Ensure that `water` is well-tested and handles edge cases, as its behavior directly impacts the correctness of `car`.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **Variable Naming (Low Severity, [Readability])**: Use more descriptive variable names instead of `a` and `b` (e.g., `num1` and `num2`) to improve code readability.
2. **PEP 8 Compliance (Low Severity, [Style])**: Ensure spaces around the assignment operator for better adherence to PEP 8 style guidelines.
3. **Encapsulation (Medium Severity, [Maintainability])**: Encapsulate the logic (e.g., summing and printing) into a function to improve reusability and maintainability.
4. **Documentation (Low Severity, [Clarity])**: Add comments or docstrings to explain the purpose of the code for better understanding.
5. **Scalability (Medium Severity, [Design])**: Consider designing the code to handle dynamic inputs instead of hardcoding values.

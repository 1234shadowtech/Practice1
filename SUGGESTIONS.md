### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Optimize Imports**: The `math` module is imported inside the function, which is unnecessary and inefficient. Move the import statement to the top of the file.
2. **Type Hinting**: The function already uses type hints for the parameter, but consider adding type hints for the return type in the docstring for consistency.
3. **Error Messages**: The error messages are clear but could be slightly more concise while retaining clarity.
4. **Edge Case Handling**: The function assumes `x` is non-negative but does not explicitly check for cases where `x` is `None`. Consider adding a check for `None` inputs.
5. **Simplify Logic**: The `isinstance` check could be combined with the `math.isfinite` check for better readability and efficiency.
6. **Testing**: Ensure the function is covered by unit tests for edge cases like `None`, `NaN`, infinity, negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers.

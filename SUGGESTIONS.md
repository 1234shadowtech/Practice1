### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Severity: High, Tag: Dependency]** - Ensure that the module `a` exists and is accessible in the current environment. If the module is missing or incorrectly named, the code will fail.
2. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Naming]** - The variable `a` shares the same name as the module `a`. This can lead to confusion and potential bugs. Consider renaming the variable to something more descriptive, such as `input_value`.
3. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Validation]** - There is no validation for the input to the `SSqr` function. If `SSqr` expects a specific type or range of values, ensure that the input is validated before calling the function.
4. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Readability]** - Add a brief comment or docstring explaining the purpose of the script for better readability and maintainability.

### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **[Severity: Low] [Optimization]**: The calculation `x * (x**0.5) * (x**0.5)` can be simplified to `x**2` for better readability and efficiency.
2. **[Severity: Medium] [Readability]**: The function name `s` is not descriptive. It should be renamed to something meaningful that reflects its purpose.
3. **[Severity: Low] [Documentation]**: The function lacks a docstring to explain its purpose, input, and output.

### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Readability]** Use more descriptive variable names instead of `a`. For example, `input_value` or `number` would make the code easier to understand.
2. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Documentation]** Add a docstring to the `main` function to explain its purpose, parameters, and return value.
3. **[Severity: High, Tag: Error Handling]** Add error handling for the `s` function call to manage potential issues, such as if `s` is not defined in module `a` or if it raises an exception.
4. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Dependency Management]** Ensure that module `a` exists and contains the function `s`. If `a` is an external dependency, document its purpose and installation requirements.
5. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Code Structure]** Consider adding a `__name__ == "__main__"` block to ensure the script runs only when executed directly, not when imported as a module.

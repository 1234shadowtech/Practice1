### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. The function `SQr` could be renamed to `sqrt` or `square_root` for better readability and adherence to Python naming conventions.  
2. The function `SQ` has a potentially confusing name and could be renamed to something more descriptive, such as `exponential_double`.  
3. The `SQ` function's logic `(x**x)*2` can lead to extremely large numbers or overflow errors for larger values of `x`. Consider adding input validation or constraints.  
4. The `car` function uses integer division (`//`), which might not be appropriate depending on the use case. Ensure this behavior is intentional.  
5. The module import `from b import water` assumes the `water` function is well-defined and tested. Ensure that `water` handles edge cases and errors gracefully.

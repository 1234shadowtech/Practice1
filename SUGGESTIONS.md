### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Low Severity] [Naming Convention]**: The function name `SQRT` does not follow Python's PEP 8 naming conventions. Function names should be in snake_case, e.g., `sqrt`.
2. **[Low Severity] [Unused Variable]**: The variable `b` is declared but never used in the code. Consider removing it if it is unnecessary.
3. **[Low Severity] [Type Hinting]**: The function `SQRT` does not include type hints for its parameter or return value. Adding type hints improves code readability and maintainability.
4. **[Low Severity] [Error Handling]**: The function does not handle cases where `x` is negative, which would result in a complex number. Consider adding error handling or documentation to clarify the expected input range.

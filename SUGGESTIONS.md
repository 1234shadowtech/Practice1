### Suggestions for `operations/basic.py`

1. The `+1` in the `add` function seems unusual and might be a mistake or require clarification. If intentional, consider adding a comment explaining its purpose to avoid confusion for future maintainers.  
2. Ensure that the `add` function's behavior aligns with its intended use in the broader application. If the `+1` is a bug, it could lead to incorrect calculations.

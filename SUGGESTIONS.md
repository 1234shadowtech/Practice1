### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. The function name `SQr` does not follow the PEP 8 naming convention for function names, which recommends using lowercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., `sqrt`).  
2. Similarly, the function name `SQ` should be renamed to follow PEP 8 conventions (e.g., `sq`).  
3. The logic in the `SQ` function seems unusual and potentially confusing. Raising `x` to the power of itself (`x**x`) can lead to extremely large numbers or errors for certain inputs (e.g., negative numbers or non-integers). Consider clarifying the purpose of this function or adding input validation.  
4. The `car` function uses the `water` function from module `b`, but there is no indication of what `water` does. Ensure that `water` is well-documented and handles edge cases properly.  
5. The `car` function performs integer division (`// 2`), which may truncate results. Confirm that this behavior is intentional.

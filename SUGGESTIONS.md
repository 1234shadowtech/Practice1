### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **Improve Function Name**: The function name `calculate_square_root_ratio` is misleading because the function does not actually calculate a ratio involving the square root of `x`. Consider renaming it to something more descriptive, such as `validate_and_process_input`.
2. **Clarify Docstring**: The docstring mentions "the ratio of the square root of x divided by itself," which is not reflected in the implementation. Update the docstring to accurately describe the function's behavior.
3. **Optimize Logic**: The function always returns `1.0` for `x > 0`, making the square root reference unnecessary. Remove any misleading references to square roots in the comments or docstring.
4. **Add Edge Case Tests**: Ensure the function is tested with edge cases like `x = 0`, `x = -1`, and very large positive numbers.
5. **Type Hint for Return Value**: The return type is correctly hinted as `float`, but explicitly returning `0.0` and `1.0` ensures consistency in the return type.
6. **Simplify Comments**: Some comments are redundant or overly verbose. Simplify them to improve readability.

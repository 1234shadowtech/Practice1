### Suggestions for `main.py`

- **BUG:** The comment for the variable `a` incorrectly states that the value assigned is 10, but the actual value assigned is 20. Update the comment to reflect the correct value.
- **STYLE:** The `floor` function lacks a comment explaining its purpose, unlike the other functions. Add a comment for consistency and clarity.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** Consider renaming the `mod` function to something more descriptive, such as `remainder_mod_10`, to make its purpose clearer.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** The `floor` function is defined but not used in the code. If it is not needed, consider removing it to avoid confusion.

### Suggestions for `second.py`

- **BUG:** The variable `n` is assigned but never used. This is redundant and should be removed to avoid confusion.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** The calculation `(sq(x) - sqr(x)) * 4` is repeated. Consider storing the result in a variable and returning it to improve readability and efficiency.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** The behavior of `sq` and `sqr` functions is not verified. Ensure that `sq` correctly computes the square of `x` and `sqr` computes the square root of `x`. If these functions are not implemented as expected, the calculation may produce incorrect results.
- **STYLE:** The function name `special` is not descriptive. Consider renaming it to something more meaningful, such as `calculate_difference` or `scaled_difference`, to better convey its purpose.

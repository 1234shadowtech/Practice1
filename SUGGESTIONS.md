### Suggestions for `second.py`

- BUG: The function `special` performs the same calculation twiceâ€”once to assign to `n` and again in the return statement. This redundancy is inefficient and could lead to unnecessary computation. Consider returning `n` directly instead of recalculating.
- POTENTIAL ISSUE: The behavior of `sq` and `sqr` functions is not verified in the provided code. Ensure these functions handle edge cases (e.g., negative numbers, zero, or non-numeric inputs) correctly, as their behavior directly impacts the correctness of `special`.
- STYLE: The variable name `n` is not descriptive. Consider using a more meaningful name, such as `result` or `difference`, to improve code readability.

### Suggestions for `second.py`

- **BUG:** Ensure that the `sq` and `sqr` functions are correctly implemented in the `first` module and handle edge cases such as negative numbers (e.g., square root of negative numbers may raise an error).
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** If `x` is a non-numeric type, this function may raise a `TypeError`. Consider adding input validation or type hints to ensure `x` is numeric.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** Add a docstring to the `special` function to clarify its purpose and expected input/output for better readability and maintainability.
- **STYLE:** The mathematical operation could be broken into intermediate variables for better readability, especially if the operation becomes more complex in the future.

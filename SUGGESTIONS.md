### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Code Readability]** Use more descriptive variable names instead of `a`. For example, `input_value` or `number` would make the code easier to understand.
2. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Documentation]** Add a docstring to the `main` function to explain its purpose, parameters, and return value.
3. **[Severity: High, Tag: Error Handling]** Add error handling for the `s` function call to manage potential issues, such as if `s` is not defined in module `a` or if it raises an exception.
4. **[Severity: Medium, Tag: Dependency Management]** Ensure that module `a` exists and contains the function `s`. If `a` is an external dependency, document its purpose and installation requirements.
5. **[Severity: Low, Tag: Code Comments]** Add comments to clarify the purpose of the code and its components for better maintainability.

### Suggestions for `a.py`

1. **[High Severity] [Naming]**: The function name `s` is not descriptive. Rename it to something meaningful, such as `cube_of_square_root` or `calculate_power`.
2. **[High Severity] [Input Validation]**: The function does not validate the input. If `x` is negative, the square root operation will result in a complex number, which might not be the intended behavior.
3. **[Medium Severity] [Performance]**: The expression `(x**0.5)` is computed three times, which is inefficient. Store the result in a variable and reuse it to improve performance.
4. **[Low Severity] [Documentation]**: The function lacks a docstring. Adding a docstring would improve code readability and explain the purpose of the function.

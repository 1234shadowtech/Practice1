### Suggestions for `main.py`

1. **[Low Severity] [Efficiency]**: The variable `i` is unused in the loop. If the loop index is not needed, consider using `_` as a convention to indicate that the variable is intentionally unused.
2. **[Low Severity] [Readability]**: If the goal is to repeat an action a fixed number of times, using a more descriptive comment or a function to encapsulate the behavior can improve readability.

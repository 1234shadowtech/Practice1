### Suggestions for `second.py`

- **BUG:** The variable `n` is calculated but never used. This is redundant and should be removed to avoid confusion.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** The calculation `(sq(x) - sqr(x)) * 4` is repeated twice (once for `n` and once for the return statement). This duplication can be avoided by directly returning the value or assigning it to `n` and returning `n`.
- **POTENTIAL ISSUE:** Ensure that the `sq` and `sqr` functions handle edge cases properly, such as negative values for `x` (if applicable). For example, the square root function (`sqr`) may raise an error or return unexpected results for negative inputs.
- **STYLE:** The function name `special` is vague and does not describe its purpose. Consider renaming it to something more descriptive, such as `calculate_difference` or `scaled_difference`.
- **STYLE:** The variable name `n` is not descriptive. If it is retained, use a more meaningful name like `result` or `scaled_difference`.

def calculate_ratio_of_square_root(x: float) -> float:  # Added type hints for input and output
    """
    Calculate the ratio of the square root of x divided by itself.
    
    Args:
        x (float): A non-negative number greater than zero.
    
    Returns:
        float: The result of the calculation, which is always 1.0 for valid inputs.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If x is negative or zero.

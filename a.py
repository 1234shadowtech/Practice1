    Validate the input `x` and return a specific value based on its value.

    Args:
        x (float): A non-negative number. Must be finite (not NaN or infinity). 
                   Note: Integers are also accepted as input.

    Returns:
        float: Returns 1.0 for any valid input greater than zero, or 0.0 for x = 0.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input is negative, NaN, infinity, or not a number.

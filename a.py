from b import water  # Importing the `water` function from module `b`.

def SQr(x):  
    return x**0.5  # Function to calculate the square root of `x`. Consider renaming to follow PEP 8 conventions.

def SQ(x):  
    return (x**x)*4  # Function to calculate `(x**x)*4`. This operation can result in very large numbers or errors for certain inputs. Consider input validation or documenting expected input types.

def car(x):  
    m = water(x)  # Calls the `water` function with `x` as input and assigns the result to `m`.
    n = water(m)  # Calls the `water` function again with `m` as input and assigns the result to `n`.
    return n // 2  # Returns the result of integer division of `n` by 2. Consider whether floating-point precision is needed.

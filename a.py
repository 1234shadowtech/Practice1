def sqr(x):

    return x*x  # Returns the square of the input `x`.

def small(x):  
    # Function to process the result of `special(x)` and divide it by 2.
    # Suggestion: Rename to something more descriptive, like `process_special`.
    # Improvement: Add error handling for `special(x)` in case it raises an exception or returns a non-numeric value.
    return special(x)//2  # Calls `special(x)` and performs integer division by 2. Ensure `special(x)` returns a numeric value.

def s(x):  
    # Function to calculate some operation on x (name is unclear and not descriptive).
    # The name `s` does not convey the purpose of the function. Consider renaming it to something meaningful.
    
    return x * x**0.5  
    # This multiplies x by the square root of x.
    # If x is positive, this will return a positive result.
    # If x is negative, this will return a complex number, which may not be the intended behavior.
    # For example:
    #   - If x = 4, the result is 4 * sqrt(4) = 4 * 2 = 8.
    #   - If x = -4, the result is -4 * sqrt(-4) = -4 * 2j = -8j (a complex number).
    # The intended purpose of this operation is unclear and should be clarified.
    # Additionally, there is no validation for the input type, which could lead to runtime errors.

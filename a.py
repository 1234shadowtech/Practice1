    # Function name 's' is not descriptive. Consider renaming it to something meaningful, like 'calculate_power' or 'compute_expression'.
    
    # The formula x * x * (x**0.5) can be simplified to x**2.5 for better clarity and efficiency.
    # Additionally, this formula assumes x is non-negative. If x is negative, this will raise a ValueError.

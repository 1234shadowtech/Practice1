def s(x): 
    # The function name 's' is not descriptive. Consider renaming it to something meaningful like 'cube' or 'calculate_cube'.
    return (x**0.5) * (x**0.5) * (x**0.5) 
    # This implementation calculates x^(1.5), not x^3. If the intention is to calculate the cube of x, use x**3.
    # Additionally, the calculation (x**0.5) * (x**0.5) is redundant and simplifies to x.

```python
def SQr(x):  
    # Function to calculate the square root of x.  
    # Issue: The name `SQr` is not descriptive and does not follow PEP 8 naming conventions.  
    # Suggestion: Rename to `square_root` or `calculate_square_root`.  
    # Improvement: Add input validation to ensure `x` is non-negative.  
    # Example: if x < 0: raise ValueError("Input must be non-negative.")
    return x**0.5  

def SQ(x):  
    # Function to calculate x raised to the power of x (x^x).  
    # Issue: The name `SQ` is not descriptive and does not follow PEP 8 naming conventions.  
    # Suggestion: Rename to `power_of_self` or something more descriptive.  
    # Issue: This is an unusual operation and may not be the intended behavior.  
    # Improvement: Add input validation to ensure `x` is within a reasonable range to avoid overflow.  
    # Example: if x < 0 or x > some_threshold: raise ValueError("Input out of range.")
    return x**x  

def car(x):  
    # Function to calculate half of x using floor division.  
    # Issue: The name `car` is not descriptive and does not follow PEP 8 naming conventions.  
    # Suggestion: Rename to `calculate_half` or `half_floor`.  
    # Improvement: Add type hints and clarify why floor division is used instead of regular division.  
    # Example: Add a comment explaining the use case for floor division (e.g., integer division for specific applications).

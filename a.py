def s(x):  
    # Function to calculate some operation on x (name is unclear and not descriptive)
    return x * x**0.5  
    # This multiplies x by the square root of x, which may not be the intended behavior.
    # For example, if x = 4, this will return 4 * sqrt(4) = 4 * 2 = 8.
    # If x = -4, this will result in a complex number: -4 * sqrt(-4) = -4 * 2j = -8j.
    # The intended purpose of this operation is unclear.

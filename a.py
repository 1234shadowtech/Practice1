def s(x):  
    # Function name 's' is not descriptive. Consider renaming it to something meaningful, e.g., 'calculate_modulo'.

    # If x is negative, x**0.5 will raise a ValueError. Add input validation to ensure x >= 0.
    
    # The purpose of the modulo operation (% 2) is unclear. Add comments or documentation to explain its intent.
    # For example, is this function checking if the result is odd/even, or is it part of a larger calculation?

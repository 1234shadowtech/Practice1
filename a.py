    """
    Calculate the ratio of the square root of x divided by itself.

    Args:
        x (float): A non-negative number.

    Returns:
        float: 1.0 for any valid input greater than zero, or 0 for x = 0.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input is negative.

    return 1.0  # Simplified logic: always return 1.0 for x > 0

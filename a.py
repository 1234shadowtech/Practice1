def s(x):  
    # Function name 's' is not descriptive. Consider renaming it to something meaningful.
    # The calculation x * (x**0.5) * (x**0.5) is equivalent to x**2 and can be simplified for better readability and efficiency.
    return x * (x**0.5) * (x**0.5)  # This computes x squared in a less efficient way.

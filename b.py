def special(x):  
    # The function takes an input `x` and performs a mathematical operation.  
    # Currently, it calculates `(x**0.5) * (x**0.5)`, which is equivalent to `x`.  
    # This operation is redundant and can be simplified to directly return `x`.  
    # Additionally, the function does not validate the input, which could lead to errors for negative values.

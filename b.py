def water(x):  # Consider renaming the function to something more descriptive, like `calculate_square_root_of_cube`.  
    m = x * x * x  # The variable name `m` is not descriptive. Consider renaming it to something like `cubed_value`.  
    return m**0.5  # This calculates the square root of the cubed value. However, the result is equivalent to `x * x`. Simplify the logic.

def special(x):   
    # The function takes an input `x` and performs a mathematical operation.
    # Currently, it calculates the square root of `x` twice and multiplies the results.
    # Mathematically, (x**0.5) * (x**0.5) is equivalent to `x`.
    return (x**0.5) * (x**0.5)  # This can be simplified to `return x` for clarity and efficiency.

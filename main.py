```python
# Print a greeting message
print("HI")  # Suggestion: Consider using a more descriptive or context-specific message (e.g., "Hello, welcome to the program!").

# Print a farewell message
print("bye")  # Suggestion: Use consistent capitalization for better readability (e.g., "Bye").
```

### ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- If this is just a test or placeholder code, no major changes are necessary.
- If this is part of a larger project:
  - Consider integrating these print statements into a function or class for better structure.
  - Add comments or docstrings to explain the purpose of these messages in the context of the program.
  - If user interaction is involved, consider adding prompts or context to the messages (e.g., "Press any key to exit. Bye!").

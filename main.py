```python
a = 10  # Assigning the value 10 to variable 'a'. Consider using a more descriptive name.
b = 20  # Assigning the value 20 to variable 'b'. Consider using a more descriptive name.
print(a + b)  # Printing the sum of 'a' and 'b'.
print(b + a)  # Redundant operation since addition is commutative. Can be removed.

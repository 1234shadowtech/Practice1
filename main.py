from a import small, sqr  # Importing `small` and `sqr` functions from module `a`. Add documentation or comments to explain their functionality and purpose (e.g., are they mathematical operations?).
from b import special  # Importing `special` function from module `b`. Add documentation or comments to explain its functionality and purpose (e.g., is it a transformation or a special calculation?).

a = 10  # Assigning the value 10 to the variable `a`. Consider renaming this variable to something more descriptive, such as `input_value` or `number`.

print(small(a))  # Calling the `small` function with `a` as an argument. Add comments or documentation to explain what this function does (e.g., does it return the smallest value?) and its expected input/output.
print(sqr(a))  # Calling the `sqr` function with `a` as an argument. Add comments or documentation to explain what this function does (e.g., does it return the square of the input?) and its expected input/output.
print(special(a))  # Calling the `special` function with `a` as an argument. Add comments or documentation to explain what this function does (e.g., does it perform a special transformation?) and its expected input/output.

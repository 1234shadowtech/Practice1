from a import SQr, SQ, car  # Importing three functions from module 'a'. Ensure the module 'a' exists and these functions are defined properly.

a = 10  # Defining a variable 'a' with the value 10. Consider using a more descriptive name, such as 'input_value' or 'number_to_process'.

print(SQr(a))  # Calling the function 'SQr' with 'a' as an argument. Ensure 'SQr' is defined and works as expected. Add comments to explain what 'SQr' does (e.g., square root calculation?).
print(SQ(a))  # Calling the function 'SQ' with 'a' as an argument. Ensure 'SQ' is defined and works as expected. Add comments to explain what 'SQ' does (e.g., squaring the number?).
print(car(a))  # Calling the function 'car' with 'a' as an argument. Ensure 'car' is defined and works as expected. Add comments to explain what 'car' does (e.g., some transformation or calculation?).

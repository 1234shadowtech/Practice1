```python
# Print a greeting message
print("HI")  # Suggestion: Consider using a more descriptive message if this is part of a larger program.

# Print a farewell message
print("bye")  # Suggestion: Consistency in capitalization might improve readability (e.g., "Bye" instead of "bye").
```

### ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- If this is just a test or placeholder code, no major changes are necessary.
- If this is part of a larger project, consider adding context or integrating it into a function or class.

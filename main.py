from a import SSqr  # Importing the SSqr function from module 'a'. Ensure that module 'a' exists and contains this function.

a = 10  # Defining a variable 'a' with the value 10. Consider renaming it to something more descriptive to avoid confusion with the module name.

print(SSqr(a))  # Calling the SSqr function with 'a' as an argument and printing the result. Ensure that the SSqr function is implemented correctly and handles the input as expected.

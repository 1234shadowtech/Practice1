```python
a = 10  # Variable 'a' is defined, but the name is not descriptive.
b = 20  # Variable 'b' is defined, but the name is not descriptive.

def ADD(x, y):  # Function name 'ADD' should follow PEP 8 naming conventions (e.g., 'add').
    return x + y  # Returns the sum of x and y.

print(ADD(a, b))  # Calls the ADD function with 'a' and 'b' and prints the result.
```

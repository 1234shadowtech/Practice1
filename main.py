from a import s  # Importing the function `s` from module `a`. Ensure that module `a` exists and contains the function `s`.
from b import car  # Importing the function `car` from module `b`. Ensure that module `b` exists and contains the function `car`.

a = 10  # Defining a variable `a` with the value 10. Consider using a more descriptive variable name, such as `input_value` or `number`.

def main(x, y):  # Defining a function `main` that takes two parameters `x` and `y`.
    return x + y  # The function returns the sum of `x` and `y`. Add a docstring to explain its purpose and parameters.

print(main(a, a))  # Calling the `main` function with `a` as both arguments and printing the result. This will print `20` if `a` is 10.

print(s(a))  # Calling the function `s` with `a` as the argument and printing the result. Ensure that `s` is defined in module `a` and works as expected. Add error handling to manage potential issues with the `s` function.

print(car(a))  # Calling the function `car` with `a` as the argument and printing the result. Ensure that `car` is defined in module `b` and works as expected. Add error handling to manage potential issues with the `car` function.

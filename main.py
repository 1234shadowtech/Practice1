from a import SQr  # Importing the `SQr` function from module `a`. Ensure the module `a` exists and the `SQr` function is implemented correctly.

a = 10  # Assigning the value 10 to the variable `a`. Consider using a more descriptive name, such as `number` or `input_value`.

# Calling the `SQr` function with `a` as an argument and printing the result.
# Add error handling to manage potential issues, such as the function not existing, invalid input, or runtime errors.
print(SQr(a))  # Ensure that the `SQr` function performs the intended operation (e.g., square root, square, etc.).

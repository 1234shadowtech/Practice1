from a import small, sqr  # Importing `small` and `sqr` functions from module `a`. These functions should be documented to explain their purpose (e.g., are they mathematical operations, transformations, or something else?).

from b import special  # Importing `special` function from module `b`. Add documentation to clarify its functionality (e.g., is it a special calculation, transformation, or something else?).

a = 10  # The variable `a` is assigned the value 10. Consider renaming it to something more descriptive, such as `input_value` or `number`, to improve readability.

print(small(a))  # Calls the `small` function with `a` as an argument. Add comments to explain what this function does, its purpose, and the expected input/output.
print(sqr(a))  # Calls the `sqr` function with `a` as an argument. Add comments to explain what this function does, its purpose, and the expected input/output.
print(special(a))  # Calls the `special` function with `a` as an argument. Add comments to explain what this function does, its purpose, and the expected input/output.

from a import small, sqr  # Importing `small` and `sqr` functions from module `a`. Add documentation to explain their functionality (e.g., are they mathematical operations?).

from b import special  # Importing `special` function from module `b`. Add documentation to explain its functionality (e.g., is it a transformation or a special calculation?).

a = 10  # The variable `a` is assigned the value 10. Consider renaming it to something more descriptive, such as `input_value` or `number`.

print(small(a))  # Calls the `small` function with `a` as an argument. Add comments to explain what this function does and its expected input/output.
print(sqr(a))  # Calls the `sqr` function with `a` as an argument. Add comments to explain what this function does and its expected input/output.
print(special(a))  # Calls the `special` function with `a` as an argument. Add comments to explain what this function does and its expected input/output.

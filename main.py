```python
def SQRT(x):  # Function to calculate the square root of a number
    return x**0.5  # Returns the square root using exponentiation

a = 10  # Variable to store the first number
b = 20  # Variable to store the second number (currently unused)
print(SQRT(a))  # Prints the square root of the value stored in 'a'

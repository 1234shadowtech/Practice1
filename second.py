from first import sqr  # Importing the `sqr` function from the `first` module. Ensure `sqr` is implemented correctly.

def super(x):  # Function to calculate the sum of two squares of `x`. The name `super` conflicts with the built-in `super()` function.
    return sqr(x) + sqr(x)  # Calls the `sqr` function twice and adds the results.

def s(x):  # Function to calculate `x` multiplied by the remainder of `x` divided by 2.
    return x * (x % 2)  # This will return 0 for even numbers and `x` for odd numbers. Ensure this behavior is intended.

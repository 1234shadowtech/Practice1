from first import sqr  # Importing the `sqr` function from the `first` module. Ensure `sqr` is implemented correctly and handles edge cases.

def super(x):  # Function to calculate the sum of two squares of `x`. The name `super` conflicts with the built-in `super()` function.
    # Inefficient: `sqr(x)` is called twice. Store the result in a variable to avoid redundant computation.
    return sqr(x) + sqr(x)  # Returns the sum of `sqr(x)` and `sqr(x)`.

def s(x):  # Function to calculate `x` multiplied by the remainder of `x` divided by 2.
    # This will return 0 for even numbers and `x` for odd numbers. Add a docstring to clarify the intended behavior.
    return x * (x % 2)  # Consider making the logic more explicit for readability.

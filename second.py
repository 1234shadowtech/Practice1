from first import sq, sqr  # Importing `sq` and `sqr` functions from the `first` module. Ensure these functions are defined and implemented correctly.

def special(x):  # Defining the `special` function, which takes one argument `x`.
    m = (sq(x) - sqr(x)) * 5  # Calculating the difference between `sq(x)` and `sqr(x)`, multiplying it by 5, and storing it in `m`.
    return (sq(x) - sqr(x)) * 5  # Returning the same calculation as above. This is redundant and can be optimized.

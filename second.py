from first import sq, sqr  # Importing the `sq` and `sqr` functions from the `first` module. Ensure these functions are defined and implemented correctly.

def special(x):  # Defining the `special` function, which takes one argument `x`.
    m = (sq(x) - sqr(x)) * 2  # Calculating the difference between `sq(x)` and `sqr(x)`, multiplying it by 2, and assigning it to `m`. However, `m` is not used.
    return (sq(x) - sqr(x)) * 2  # Returning the same calculation as above. This results in redundant computation.
